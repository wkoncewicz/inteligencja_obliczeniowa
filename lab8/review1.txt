Stay clear of this place unless you want a ride staff with a below average hotel! The rudest staff I have ever encountered and I travel all over the world. they treated us like second hand citizens. Just Awful. Food was terrible and stale. I didnt think it was possible to get stale bake goods in Italy but somehow they achieved it. Front desk staff during the morning on 4/9/25 was so rude it was unbelievable. She actually yelled at me for taking some tap water from the lobby. Tried to eat dinner at the restaurant it seemed to be an inconvenience for the waiter to wait on us. Never brought us water and wouldnâ€™t bring us a check. Had to go to the front desk to actually pay the bill. STAY CLEAR !
