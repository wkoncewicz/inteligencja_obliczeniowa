Wonderful experience at the Black hotel. We had a very, very good time, we stayed in a room that they call Superior, very clean, as well as the bathroom and we enjoyed a very comfortable terrace. The breakfast very satisfying I must say and the blonde lady at the reception pampered us in a friendly way but with a marked kindness gave us all the directions to visit Rome effectively. As soon as we can we will definitely return, beautiful design. We loved the taste in the lobby decor and the door which is a real work of art. Very useful parking, free
