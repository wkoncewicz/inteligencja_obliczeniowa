A GAME OF THRONES
Book One of A Song of Ice and Fire
By George R.R. Martin

PROLOGUE
We should start back,” Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them. “The
wildlings are dead.”
“Do the dead frighten you?” Ser Waymar Royce asked with just the hint of a smile.
Gared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the
lordlings come and go. “Dead is dead,” he said. “We have no business with the dead.”
“Are they dead?” Royce asked softly. “What proof have we?”
“Will saw them,” Gared said. “If he says they are dead, that’s proof enough for me.”
Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had
been later rather than sooner. “My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,” he put
in.
“My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,” Royce replied. “Never believe anything you
hear at a woman’s tit. There are things to be learned even from the dead.” His voice
echoed, too loud in the twilit forest.
“We have a long ride before us,” Gared pointed out. “Eight days, maybe nine. And night
is falling.”
Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. “It does that every day about this
time. Are you unmanned by the dark, Gared?”
Will could see the tightness around Gared’s mouth, the barely suppressed anger in his
eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the Night’s
Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more
than that. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man.
You could taste it; a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear.
Will shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been
sent beyond, all the old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had turned to
water. He had laughed about it afterward. He was a veteran of a hundred rangings by
now, and the endless dark wilderness that the southron called the haunted forest had no
more terrors for him.
Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that
made his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then
north again, farther and farther from the Wall, hard on the track of a band of wildling
raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had come before it. Today was the
worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the trees rustle like
living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something
cold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so
much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share
with your commander.
Especially not a commander like this one.
Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He
was a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife.
Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their
smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves,
and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled
leather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch for less than half a
year, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his
wardrobe was concerned.
His cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. “Bet he killed
them all himself, he did,” Gared told the barracks over wine, “twisted their little heads
off, our mighty warrior.” They had all shared the laugh.
It is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat
shivering atop his garron. Gared must have felt the same.
“Mormont said as we should track them, and we did,” Gared said. “They’re dead. They
shan’t trouble us no more. There’s hard riding before us. I don’t like this weather. If it
snows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow’s the best we can hope for. Ever
seen an ice storm, my lord?”
The lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that half-
bored, half-distracted way he had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough to
understand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that. “Tell me again
what you saw, Will. All the details. Leave nothing out.”
Will had been a hunter before he joined the Night’s Watch. Well, a poacher in truth.
Mallister freeriders had caught him red-handed in the Mallisters’ own woods, skinning
one of the Mallisters’ own bucks, and it had been a choice of putting on the black or
losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as silent as Will, and it had not
taken the black brothers long to discover his talent.
“The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside a stream,” Will said. “I
got close as I dared. There’s eight of them, men and women both. No children I could
see. They put up a lean-to against the rock. The snow’s pretty well covered it now, but I
could still make it out. No fire burning, but the firepit was still plain as day. No one
moving. I watched a long time. No living man ever lay so still.”
“Did you see any blood?”
“Well, no,” Will admitted.
“Did you see any weapons?”
“Some swords, a few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-bladed, a cruel
piece of iron. It was on the ground beside him, right by his hand.”
“Did you make note of the position of the bodies?”
Will shrugged. “A couple are sitting up against the rock. Most of them on the ground.
Fallen, like.”
“Or sleeping,” Royce suggested.
“Fallen,” Will insisted. “There’s one woman up an ironwood, half-hid in the branches. A
far-eyes.” He smiled thinly. “I took care she never saw me. When I got closer, I saw that
she wasn’t moving neither.” Despite himself, he shivered.
“You have a chill?” Royce asked.
“Some,” Will muttered. “The wind, m’lord.”
The young knight turned back to his grizzled man-at-arms. Frostfallen leaves whispered
past them, and Royce’s destrier moved restlessly. “What do you think might have killed
these men, Gared?” Ser Waymar asked casually. He adjusted the drape of his long sable
cloak.
“It was the cold,” Gared said with iron certainty. “I saw men freeze last winter, and the
one before, when I was half a boy. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and how
the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold. It steals up
on you quieter than Will, and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp
your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires. It burns, it does. Nothing burns
like the cold. But only for a while. Then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up, and
after a while you don’t have the strength to fight it. It’s easier just to sit down or go to
sleep. They say you don’t feel any pain toward the end. First you go weak and drowsy,
and everything starts to fade, and then it’s like sinking into a sea of warm milk. Peaceful,
like.”
“Such eloquence, Gared,” Ser Waymar observed. “I never suspected you had it in you.”
“I’ve had the cold in me too, lordling.” Gared pulled back his hood, giving Ser Waymar a
good long look at the stumps where his ears had been. “Two ears, three toes, and the
little finger off my left hand. I got off light. We found my brother frozen at his watch,
with a smile on his face.”
Ser Waymar shrugged. “You ought dress more warmly, Gared.”
Gared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where
Maester Aemon had cut the ears away. “We’ll see how warm you can dress when the
winter comes.” He pulled up his hood and hunched over his garron, silent and sullen.
“If Gared said it was the cold . . . ” Will began.
“Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?”
“Yes, m’lord.” There never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches.
What was the man driving at?
“And how did you find the Wall?”
“Weeping,” Will said, frowning. He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling had
pointed it out. “They couldn’t have froze. Not if the Wall was weeping. It wasn’t cold
enough.”
Royce nodded. “Bright lad. We’ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry
of snow now and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men. Men
clad in fur and leather, let me remind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of
making fire.” The knight’s smile was cocksure. “Will, lead us there. I would see these
dead men for myself.”
And then there was nothing to be done for it. The order had been given, and honor
bound them to obey.
Will went in front, his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the
undergrowth. A light snow had fallen the night before, and there were stones and roots
and hidden sinks lying just under its crust, waiting for the careless and the unwary. Ser
Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier snorting impatiently. The warhorse
was the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that to the lordling. Gared brought up
the rear. The old man-at-arms muttered to himself as he rode.
Twilight deepened. The cloudless sky turned a deep purple, the color of an old bruise,
then faded to black. The stars began to come out. A half-moon rose. Will was grateful for
the light.
“We can make a better pace than this, surely,” Royce said when the moon was full risen.
“Not with this horse,” Will said. Fear had made him insolent. “Perhaps my lord would
care to take the lead?”
Ser Waymar Royce did not deign to reply.
Somewhere off in the wood a wolf howled.
Will pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted.
“Why are you stopping?” Ser Waymar asked.
“Best go the rest of the way on foot, m’lord. It’s just over that ridge.”
Royce paused a moment, staring off into the distance, his face reflective. A cold wind
whispered through the trees. His great sable cloak stirred behind like something half-
alive.
“There’s something wrong here,” Gared muttered.
The young knight gave him a disdainful smile. “Is there?”
“Can’t you feel it?” Gared asked. “Listen to the darkness.”
Will could feel it. Four years in the Night’s Watch, and he had never been so afraid.
What was it?
“Wind. Trees rustling. A wolf. Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared?” When
Gared did not answer, Royce slid gracefully from his saddle. He tied the destrier securely
to a low-hanging limb, well away from the other horses, and drew his longsword from its
sheath. Jewels glittered in its hilt, and the moonlight ran down the shining steel. It was a
splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-made from the look of it. Will doubted it had
ever been swung in anger.
“The trees press close here,” Will warned. “That sword will tangle you up, m’lord. Better
a knife.”
“If I need instruction, I will ask for it,” the young lord said. “Gared, stay here. Guard the
horses.”
Gared dismounted. “We need a fire. I’ll see to it.”
“How big a fool are you, old man? If there are enemies in this wood, a fire is the last
thing we want.”
“There’s some enemies a fire will keep away,” Gared said. “Bears and direwolves
and . . . and other things . . . ”
Ser Waymar’s mouth became a hard line. “No fire.”
Gared’s hood shadowed his face, but Will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he
stared at the knight. For a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword.
It was a short, ugly thing, its grip discolored by sweat, its edge nicked from hard use, but
Will would not have given an iron bob for the lordling’s life if Gared pulled it from its
scabbard.
Finally Gared looked down. “No fire,” he muttered, low under his breath.
Royce took it for acquiescence and turned away. “Lead on,” he said to Will.
Will threaded their way through a thicket, then started up the slope to the low ridge
where he had found his vantage point under a sentinel tree. Under the thin crust of
snow, the ground was damp and muddy, slick footing, with rocks and hidden roots to
trip you up. Will made no sound as he climbed. Behind him, he heard the soft metallic
slither of the lordling’s ringmail, the rustle of leaves, and muttered curses as reaching
branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak.
The great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would
be, its lowest branches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in underneath, flat on his
belly in the snow and the mud, and looked down on the empty clearing below.
His heart stopped in his chest. For a moment he dared not breathe. Moonlight shone
down on the clearing, the ashes of the firepit, the snow-covered lean-to, the great rock,
the little half-frozen stream. Everything was just as it had been a few hours ago.
They were gone. All the bodies were gone.
“Gods!” he heard behind him. A sword slashed at a branch as Ser Waymar Royce gained
the ridge. He stood there beside the sentinel, longsword in hand, his cloak billowing
behind him as the wind came up, outlined nobly against the stars for all to see.
“Get down!” Will whispered urgently. “Something’s wrong.”
Royce did not move. He looked down at the empty clearing and laughed. “Your dead
men seem to have moved camp, Will.”
Will’s voice abandoned him. He groped for words that did not come. It was not possible.
His eyes swept back and forth over the abandoned campsite, stopped on the axe. A huge
double-bladed battle-axe, still lying where he had seen it last, untouched. A valuable
weapon . . .
“On your feet, Will,” Ser Waymar commanded. “There’s no one here. I won’t have you
hiding under a bush.”
Reluctantly, Will obeyed.
Ser Waymar looked him over with open disapproval. “I am not going back to Castle
Black a failure on my first ranging. We will find these men.” He glanced around. “Up the
tree. Be quick about it. Look for a fire.”
Will turned away, wordless. There was no use to argue. The wind was moving. It cut
right through him. He went to the tree, a vaulting grey-green sentinel, and began to
climb. Soon his hands were sticky with sap, and he was lost among the needles. Fear
filled his gut like a meal he could not digest. He whispered a prayer to the nameless gods
of the wood, and slipped his dirk free of its sheath. He put it between his teeth to keep
both hands free for climbing. The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort.
Down below, the lordling called out suddenly, “Who goes there?” Will heard uncertainty
in the challenge. He stopped climbing; he listened; he watched.
The woods gave answer: the rustle of leaves, the icy rush of the stream, a distant hoot of
a snow owl.
The Others made no sound.
Will saw movement from the corner of his eye. Pale shapes gliding through the wood. He
turned his head, glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness. Then it was gone. Branches
stirred gently in the wind, scratching at one another with wooden fingers. Will opened
his mouth to call down a warning, and the words seemed to freeze in his throat. Perhaps
he was wrong. Perhaps it had only been a bird, a reflection on the snow, some trick of
the moonlight. What had he seen, after all?
“Will, where are you?” Ser Waymar called up. “Can you see anything?” He was turning in
a slow circle, suddenly wary, his sword in hand. He must have felt them, as Will felt
them. There was nothing to see. “Answer me! Why is it so cold?”
It was cold. Shivering, Will clung more tightly to his perch. His face pressed hard
against the trunk of the sentinel. He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on his cheek.
A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of Royce. Tall, it was, and
gaunt and hard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk. Its armor seemed to change color as
it moved; here it was white as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere
dappled with the deep grey-green of the trees. The patterns ran like moonlight on water
with every step it took.
Will heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss. “Come no farther,” the
lordling warned. His voice cracked like a boy’s. He threw the long sable cloak back over
his shoulders, to free his arms for battle, and took his sword in both hands. The wind
had stopped. It was very cold.
The Other slid forward on silent feet. In its hand was a longsword like none that Will had
ever seen. No human metal had gone into the forging of that blade. It was alive with
moonlight, translucent, a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when
seen edge-on. There was a faint blue shimmer to the thing, a ghost-light that played
around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor.
Ser Waymar met him bravely. “Dance with me then.” He lifted his sword high over his
head, defiant. His hands trembled from the weight of it, or perhaps from the cold. Yet in
that moment, Will thought, he was a boy no longer, but a man of the Night’s Watch.
The Other halted. Will saw its eyes; blue, deeper and bluer than any human eyes, a blue
that burned like ice. They fixed on the longsword trembling on high, watched the
moonlight running cold along the metal. For a heartbeat he dared to hope.
They emerged silently from the shadows, twins to the first. Three of
them . . . four . . . five . . . Ser Waymar may have felt the cold that came with them, but he
never saw them, never heard them. Will had to call out. It was his duty. And his death, if
he did. He shivered, and hugged the tree, and kept the silence.
The pale sword came shivering through the air.
Ser Waymar met it with steel. When the blades met, there was no ring of metal on metal;
only a high, thin sound at the edge of hearing, like an animal screaming in pain. Royce
checked a second blow, and a third, then fell back a step. Another flurry of blows, and he
fell back again.
Behind him, to right, to left, all around him, the watchers stood patient, faceless, silent,
the shifting patterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood.
Yet they made no move to interfere.
Again and again the swords met, until Will wanted to cover his ears against the strange
anguished keening of their clash. Ser Waymar was panting from the effort now, his
breath steaming in the moonlight. His blade was white with frost; the Other’s danced
with pale blue light.
Then Royce’s parry came a beat too late. The pale sword bit through the ringmail
beneath his arm. The young lord cried out in pain. Blood welled between the rings. It
steamed in the cold, and the droplets seemed red as fire where they touched the snow.
Ser Waymar’s fingers brushed his side. His moleskin glove came away soaked with red.
The Other said something in a language that Will did not know; his voice was like the
cracking of ice on a winter lake, and the words were mocking.
Ser Waymar Royce found his fury. “For Robert!” he shouted, and he came up snarling,
lifting the frost-covered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat
sidearm slash with all his weight behind it. The Other’s parry was almost lazy.
When the blades touched, the steel shattered.
A scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred
brittle pieces, the shards scattering like a rain of needles. Royce went to his knees,
shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood welled between his fingers.
The watchers moved forward together, as if some signal had been given. Swords rose
and fell, all in a deathly silence. It was cold butchery. The pale blades sliced through
ringmail as if it were silk. Will closed his eyes. Far beneath him, he heard their voices
and laughter sharp as icicles.
When he found the courage to look again, a long time had passed, and the ridge below
was empty.
He stayed in the tree, scarce daring to breathe, while the moon crept slowly across the
black sky. Finally, his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold, he climbed
down.
Royce’s body lay facedown in the snow, one arm outflung. The thick sable cloak had
been slashed in a dozen places. Lying dead like that, you saw how young he was. A boy.
He found what was left of the sword a few feet away, the end splintered and twisted like
a tree struck by lightning. Will knelt, looked around warily, and snatched it up. The
broken sword would be his proof. Gared would know what to make of it, and if not him,
then surely that old bear Mormont or Maester Aemon. Would Gared still be waiting with
the horses? He had to hurry.
Will rose. Ser Waymar Royce stood over him.
His fine clothes were a tatter, his face a ruin. A shard from his sword transfixed the blind
white pupil of his left eye.
The right eye was open. The pupil burned blue. It saw.
The broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to pray. Long, elegant
hands brushed his cheek, then tightened around his throat. They were gloved in the
finest moleskin and sticky with blood, yet the touch was icy cold.

BRAN
The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of
summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode
among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old
enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king’s justice done. It was
the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran’s life.
The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a
wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran’s
skin prickle to think of it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The
wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with
giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished
horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-
human children.
But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king’s
justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a
finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in black, the same as a brother of the Night’s
Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy.
The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord
father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them. Robb and Jon sat
tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his pony, trying to seem older
than seven, trying to pretend that he’d seen all this before. A faint wind blew through the
holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey
direwolf racing across an ice-white field.
Bran’s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely
trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He
had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit
before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the
forest. He had taken off Father’s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark
of Winterfell.
There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but
afterward Bran could not recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave
a command, and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump
in the center of the square. They forced his head down onto the hard black wood. Lord
Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword. “Ice,”
that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man’s hand, and taller even than Robb.
The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like
Valyrian steel.
His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his
household guard. He took hold of Ice with both hands and said, “In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and
the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of
Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, I do sentence
you to die.” He lifted the greatsword high above his head.
Bran’s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. “Keep the pony well in hand,” he
whispered. “And don’t look away. Father will know if you do.”
Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away.
His father took off the man’s head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the
snow, as red as surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep
from bolting. Bran could not take his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump
drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched.
The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy’s feet. Theon was
a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot
on the head, and kicked it away.
“Ass,” Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran’s
shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. “You did well,” Jon told him
solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.
It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then
and the sun was higher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main
party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses.
“The deserter died bravely,” Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day,
with his mother’s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of
Riverrun. “He had courage, at the least.”
“No,” Jon Snow said quietly. “It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could
see it in his eyes, Stark.” Jon’s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but
there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike.
Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and
quick where his half brother was strong and fast.
Robb was not impressed. “The Others take his eyes,” he swore. “He died well. Race you
to the bridge?”
“Done,” Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they
galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The
hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.
Bran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man’s
eyes, and he was thinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb’s laughter
receded, and the woods grew silent again.
So deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father
moved up to ride beside him. “Are you well, Bran?” he asked, not unkindly.
“Yes, Father,” Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted
on his great warhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. “Robb says the man
died bravely, but Jon says he was afraid.”
“What do you think?” his father asked.
Bran thought about it. “Can a man still be brave if he’s afraid?”
“That is the only time a man can be brave,” his father told him. “Do you understand why
I did it?”
“He was a wildling,” Bran said. “They carry off women and sell them to the Others.”
His lord father smiled. “Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man
was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night’s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The
deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no
matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but
why I must do it.”
Bran had no answer for that. “King Robert has a headsman,” he said, uncertainly.
“He does,” his father admitted. “As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is
the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we
hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you
would take a man’s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words.
And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.
“One day, Bran, you will be Robb’s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your
brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take
no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid
executioners soon forgets what death is.”
That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and
shouted down at them. “Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!” Then
he was gone again.
Jory rode up beside them. “Trouble, my lord?”
“Beyond a doubt,” his lord father said. “Come, let us see what mischief my sons have
rooted out now.” He sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after.
They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside
him. The late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-deep in
white, his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in
his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices.
The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the
hidden, uneven ground. Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys.
Greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him.
“Gods!” he exclaimed, struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword.
Jory’s sword was already out. “Robb, get away from it!” he called as his horse reared
under him.
Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. “She can’t hurt you,” he said.
“She’s dead, Jory.”
Bran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his
father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran jumped off
and ran.
By then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. “What in the seven
hells is it?” Greyjoy was saying.
“A wolf,” Robb told him.
“A freak,” Greyjoy said. “Look at the size of it.”
Bran’s heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his
brothers’ side.
Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed
in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman’s
perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed
teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the
size of the largest hound in his father’s kennel.
“It’s no freak,” Jon said calmly. “That’s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.”
Theon Greyjoy said, “There’s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two
hundred years.”
“I see one now,” Jon replied.
Bran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in
Robb’s arms. He gave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey-
black fur, its eyes still closed. It nuzzled blindly against Robb’s chest as he cradled it,
searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad little whimpery sound. Bran
reached out hesitantly. “Go on,” Robb told him. “You can touch him.”
Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, “Here you go.” His
half brother put a second pup into his arms. “There are five of them.” Bran sat down in
the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his
cheek.
“Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,” muttered Hullen, the master of
horse. “I like it not.”
“It is a sign,” Jory said.
Father frowned. “This is only a dead animal, Jory,” he said. Yet he seemed troubled.
Snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body. “Do we know what killed
her?”
“There’s something in the throat,” Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before
his father even asked. “There, just under the jaw.”
His father knelt and groped under the beast’s head with his hand. He gave a yank and
held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with blood.
A sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and
no one dared to speak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand.
His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. “I’m
surprised she lived long enough to whelp,” he said. His voice broke the spell.
“Maybe she didn’t,” Jory said. “I’ve heard tales . . . maybe the bitch was already dead
when the pups came.”
“Born with the dead,” another man put in. “Worse luck.”
“No matter,” said Hullen. “They be dead soon enough too.”
Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.
“The sooner the better,” Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. “Give the beast here,
Bran.”
The little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. “No!” Bran cried
out fiercely. “It’s mine.”
“Put away your sword, Greyjoy,” Robb said. For a moment he sounded as commanding
as their father, like the lord he would someday be. “We will keep these pups.”
“You cannot do that, boy,” said Harwin, who was Hullen’s son.
“It be a mercy to kill them,” Hullen said.
Bran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. “Hullen
speaks truly, son. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.”
“No!” He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to cry
in front of his father.
Robb resisted stubbornly. “Ser Rodrik’s red bitch whelped again last week,” he said. “It
was a small litter, only two live pups. She’ll have milk enough.”
“She’ll rip them apart when they try to nurse.”
“Lord Stark,” Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran
looked at him with desperate hope. “There are five pups,” he told Father. “Three male,
two female.”
“What of it, Jon?”
“You have five trueborn children,” Jon said. “Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is
the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.”
Bran saw his father’s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon
with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had
done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included
the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname
Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to
be born with no name of their own.
Their father understood as well. “You want no pup for yourself, Jon?” he asked softly.
“The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,” Jon pointed out. “I am no Stark,
Father.”
Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. “I will
nurse him myself, Father,” he promised. “I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give
him suck from that.”
“Me too!” Bran echoed.
The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. “Easy to say, and harder to
do. I will not have you wasting the servants’ time with this. If you want these pups, you
will feed them yourselves. Is that understood?”
Bran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm
tongue.
“You must train them as well,” their father said. “You must train them. The
kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the
gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize them, or train them badly. These are not
dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf will rip a man’s arm off his
shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?”
“Yes, Father,” Bran said.
“Yes,” Robb agreed.
“The pups may die anyway, despite all you do.”
“They won’t die,” Robb said. “We won’t let them die.”
“Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. It’s time we were back to
Winterfell.”
It was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste
the sweet air of victory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against
him, safe for the long ride home. Bran was wondering what to name him.
Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.
“What is it, Jon?” their lord father asked.
“Can’t you hear it?”
Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks,
the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.
“There,” Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They
watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A
moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.
“He must have crawled away from the others,” Jon said.
“Or been driven away,” their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white,
where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man
who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have
opened his eyes while the others were still blind.
“An albino,” Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. “This one will die even faster than
the others.”
Jon Snow gave his father’s ward a long, chilling look. “I think not, Greyjoy,” he said.
“This one belongs to me.”

CATELYN
Catelyn had never liked this godswood.
She had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red Fork of the Trident.
The godswood there was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled
shadows across tinkling streams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy
with the scent of flowers.
The gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal place, three
acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it.
It smelled of moist earth and decay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of
stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green needles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as
old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks crowded close together while twisted
branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the
soil. This was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here
had no names.
But she knew she would find her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a man’s life,
afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood.
Catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that
filled the sept of Riverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his
father before him. Her gods had names, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of
her parents. Worship was a septon with a censer, the smell of incense, a seven-sided
crystal alive with light, voices raised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great
houses did, but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the
sept.
For her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god,
but the blood of the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods
were the old ones, the nameless, faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the
vanished children of the forest.
At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the
waters were black and cold. “The heart tree,” Ned called it. The weirwood’s bark was
white as bone, its leaves dark red, like a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been
carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features long and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes
red with dried sap and strangely watchful. They were old, those eyes; older than
Winterfell itself. They had seen Brandon the Builder set the first stone, if the tales were
true; they had watched the castle’s granite walls rise around them. It was said that the
children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before
the coming of the First Men across the narrow sea.
In the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago,
except on the Isle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. Up here it was
different. Here every castle had its godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree,
and every heart tree its face.
Catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The
greatsword Ice was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as
night. A thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the
sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came.
“Ned,” she called softly.
He lifted his head to look at her. “Catelyn,” he said. His voice was distant and formal.
“Where are the children?”
He would always ask her that. “In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups.”
She spread her cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool, her back to the
weirwood. She could feel the eyes watching her, but she did her best to ignore them.
“Arya is already in love, and Sansa is charmed and gracious, but Rickon is not quite
sure.”
“Is he afraid?” Ned asked.
“A little,” she admitted. “He is only three.”
Ned frowned. “He must learn to face his fears. He will not be three forever. And winter is
coming.”
“Yes,” Catelyn agreed. The words gave her a chill, as they always did. The Stark words.
Every noble house had its words. Family mottoes, touchstones, prayers of sorts, they
boasted of honor and glory, promised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. All but
the Starks. Winter is coming, said the Stark words. Not for the first time, she reflected
on what a strange people these northerners were.
“The man died well, I’ll give him that,” Ned said. He had a swatch of oiled leather in one
hand. He ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow.
“I was glad for Bran’s sake. You would have been proud of Bran.”
“I am always proud of Bran,” Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it. She
could see the rippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on
itself a hundred times in the forging. Catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not
deny that Ice had its own beauty. It had been forged in Valyria, before the Doom had
come to the old Freehold, when the ironsmiths had worked their metal with spells as
well as hammers. Four hundred years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was forged.
The name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the Starks were
Kings in the North.
“He was the fourth this year,” Ned said grimly. “The poor man was half-mad. Something
had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him.” He sighed. “Ben
writes that the strength of the Night’s Watch is down below a thousand. It’s not only
desertions. They are losing men on rangings as well.”
“Is it the wildlings?” she asked.
“Who else?” Ned lifted Ice, looked down the cool steel length of it. “And it will only grow
worse. The day may come when I will have no choice but to call the banners and ride
north to deal with this King-beyond-the-Wall for good and all.”
“Beyond the Wall?” The thought made Catelyn shudder.
Ned saw the dread on her face. “Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear.”
“There are darker things beyond the Wall.” She glanced behind her at the heart tree, the
pale bark and red eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow thoughts.
His smile was gentle. “You listen to too many of Old Nan’s stories. The Others are as
dead as the children of the forest, gone eight thousand years. Maester Luwin will tell you
they never lived at all. No living man has ever seen one.”
“Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either,” Catelyn reminded
him.
“I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully,” he said with a rueful smile. He slid
Ice back into its sheath. “You did not come here to tell me crib tales. I know how little
you like this place. What is it, my lady?”
Catelyn took her husband’s hand. “There was grievous news today, my lord. I did not
wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself.” There was no way to soften the
blow, so she told him straight. “I am so sorry, my love. Jon Arryn is dead.”
His eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as she had known it would.
In his youth, Ned had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord Arryn had become a
second father to him and his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon. When the Mad King Aerys
II Targaryen had demanded their heads, the Lord of the Eyrie had raised his moon-and-
falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had pledged to protect.
And one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as well, as he and
Ned stood together in the sept at Riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of Lord
Hoster Tully.
“Jon . . . ” he said. “Is this news certain?”
“It was the king’s seal, and the letter is in Robert’s own hand. I saved it for you. He said
Lord Arryn was taken quickly. Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brought the
milk of the poppy, so Jon did not linger long in pain.”
“That is some small mercy, I suppose,” he said. She could see the grief on his face, but
even then he thought first of her. “Your sister,” he said. “And Jon’s boy. What word of
them?”
“The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie,” Catelyn said.
“I wish they had gone to Riverrun instead. The Eyrie is high and lonely, and it was ever
her husband’s place, not hers. Lord Jon’s memory will haunt each stone. I know my
sister. She needs the comfort of family and friends around her.”
“Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not? Jon named him Knight of the Gate, I’d
heard.”
Catelyn nodded. “Brynden will do what he can for her, and for the boy. That is some
comfort, but still . . . ”
“Go to her,” Ned urged. “Take the children. Fill her halls with noise and shouts and
laughter. That boy of hers needs other children about him, and Lysa should not be alone
in her grief.”
“Would that I could,” Catelyn said. “The letter had other tidings. The king is riding to
Winterfell to seek you out.”
It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the understanding came, the
darkness left his eyes. “Robert is coming here?” When she nodded, a smile broke across
his face.
Catelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a
direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a
snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who put no faith in
signs. “I knew that would please you,” she said. “We should send word to your brother
on the Wall.”
“Yes, of course,” he agreed. “Ben will want to be here. I shall tell Maester Luwin to send
his swiftest bird.” Ned rose and pulled her to her feet. “Damnation, how many years has
it been? And he gives us no more notice than this? How many in his party, did the
message say?”
“I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as
many freeriders. Cersei and the children travel with them.”
“Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,” he said. “It is just as well. That will give
us more time to prepare.”
“The queen’s brothers are also in the party,” she told him.
Ned grimaced at that. There was small love between him and the queen’s family, Catelyn
knew. The Lannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert’s cause, when victory was
all but certain, and he had never forgiven them. “Well, if the price for Robert’s company
is an infestation of Lannisters, so be it. It sounds as though Robert is bringing half his
court.”
“Where the king goes, the realm follows,” she said.
“It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister
woman’s teat the last time I saw him. He must be, what, five by now?”
“Prince Tommen is seven,” she told him. “The same age as Bran. Please, Ned, guard your
tongue. The Lannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow with every
passing year.”
Ned squeezed her hand. “There must be a feast, of course, with singers, and Robert will
want to hunt. I shall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad
and escort them back. Gods, how are we going to feed them all? On his way already, you
said? Damn the man. Damn his royal hide.”

DAENERYS
Her brother held the gown up for her inspection. “This is beauty. Touch it. Go on. Caress
the fabric.”
Dany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like
water. She could not remember ever wearing anything so soft. It frightened her. She
pulled her hand away. “Is it really mine?”
“A gift from the Magister Illyrio,” Viserys said, smiling. Her brother was in a high mood
tonight. “The color will bring out the violet in your eyes. And you shall have gold as well,
and jewels of all sorts. Illyrio has promised. Tonight you must look like a princess.”
A princess, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like. Perhaps she had never
really known. “Why does he give us so much?” she asked. “What does he want from us?”
For nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magister’s house, eating his food, pampered
by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old enough to know that such gifts seldom come
without their price, here in the free city of Pentos.
“Illyrio is no fool,” Viserys said. He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a
feverish look in his pale lilac eyes. “The magister knows that I will not forget my friends
when I come into my throne.”
Dany said nothing. Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and
other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and
even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said
that he’d never had a friend he wouldn’t cheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened
to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but she knew better than to
question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. His anger was a terrible thing
when roused. Viserys called it “waking the dragon.”
Her brother hung the gown beside the door. “Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you. Be
sure you wash off the stink of the stables. Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he
looks for a different sort of mount.” He studied her critically. “You still slouch.
Straighten yourself” He pushed back her shoulders with his hands. “Let them see that
you have a woman’s shape now.” His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts
and tightened on a nipple. “You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you.
You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?” His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly
hard through the rough fabric of her tunic. “Do you?” he repeated.
“No,” Dany said meekly.
Her brother smiled. “Good.” He touched her hair, almost with affection. “When they
write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight.”
When he was gone, Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of
the bay. The square brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the
setting sun. Dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and
the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate. For a
moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and breathless and
dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogo’s
manse.
Somewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and
flowered plains and great rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst
magnificent blue-grey mountains, and armored knights rode to battle beneath the
banners of their lords. The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh Andahli, the land of the
Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms. Her
brother had a simpler name. “Our land,” he called it. The words were like a prayer with
him. If he said them enough, the gods were sure to hear. “Ours by blood right, taken
from us by treachery, but ours still, ours forever. You do not steal from the dragon, oh,
no. The dragon remembers.”
And perhaps the dragon did remember, but Dany could not. She had never seen this
land her brother said was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These places he
talked of, Casterly Rock and the Eyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the
Isle of Faces, they were just words to her. Viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled
King’s Landing to escape the advancing armies of the Usurper, but Daenerys had been
only a quickening in their mother’s womb.
Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her
the stories. The midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship’s
black sails. Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident
and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of King’s Landing by the ones Viserys called
the Usurper’s dogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess Elia of Dorne pleading for
mercy as Rhaegar’s heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes. The
polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne
room while the Kingslayer opened Father’s throat with a golden sword.
She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer
storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The
Targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped
from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea. Her mother
had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never forgiven her.
She did not remember Dragonstone either. They had run again, just before the Usurper’s
brother set sail with his new-built fleet. By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat
of their House, had remained of the Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs. It would
not remain for long. The garrison had been prepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one
night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them
both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the
Braavosian coast.
She remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, roaring and
bellowing orders from his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had
always been kind to Dany. He called her “Little Princess” and sometimes “My Lady,” and
his hands were soft as old leather. He never left his bed, though, and the smell of
sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor. That was when they
lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany had her own room there, with
a lemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen
what little money they had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house.
Dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever.
They had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to
Qohor and Volantis and Lys, never staying long in any one place. Her brother would not
allow it. The Usurper’s hired knives were close behind them, he insisted, though Dany
had never seen one.
At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the
last Targaryens to their homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper
continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years
past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin they had
gotten from Mother’s crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of Pentos, they called
her brother “the beggar king.” Dany did not want to know what they called her.
“We will have it all back someday, sweet sister,” he would promise her. Sometimes his
hands shook when he talked about it. “The jewels and the silks, Dragonstone and King’s
Landing, the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will
have it back.” Viserys lived for that day. All that Daenerys wanted back was the big house
with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, the childhood she had never
known.
There came a soft knock on her door. “Come,” Dany said, turning away from the
window. Illyrio’s servants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were
slaves, a gift from one of the magister’s many Dothraki friends. There was no slavery in
the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. The old woman, small and grey as
a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was Illyrio’s favorite, a fair-
haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked.
They filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with
fragrant oils. The girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany’s head and helped her into
the tub. The water was scalding hot, but Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the
heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother had often told her that it was never too
hot for a Targaryen. “Ours is the house of the dragon,” he would say. “The fire is in our
blood.”
The old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in
silence. The girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was. “Drogo
is so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. A hundred thousand men ride in his
khalasar, and his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid
silver.” There was more like that, so much more, what a handsome man the khal was, so
tall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever to mount a horse, a demon archer.
Daenerys said nothing. She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she
came of age. For centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since Aegon the
Conqueror had taken his sisters to bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had told
her a thousand times; theirs was the kingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the
blood of the dragon. Dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field, and Targaryens
did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys schemed to sell her
to a stranger, a barbarian.
When she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. The girl
brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with
the spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on
the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool on her lips, down there between her legs.
They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, and then the gown, a
deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals onto her
feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted
with amethysts around her wrists. Last of all came the collar, a heavy golden torc
emblazoned with ancient Valyrian glyphs.
“Now you look all a princess,” the girl said breathlessly when they were done. Dany
glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully
provided. A princess, she thought, but she remembered what the girl had said, how Khal
Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. She felt a sudden chill, and
gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms.
Her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, his
hand trailing in the water. He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically.
“Stand there,” he told her. “Turn around. Yes. Good. You look . . . ”
“Regal,” Magister Illyrio said, stepping through an archway. He moved with surprising
delicacy for such a massive man. Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of
fat jiggled as he walked. Gemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his
forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold. “May the Lord of Light shower you with
blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys,” the magister said as he took
her hand. He bowed his head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through
the gold of his beard. “She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision,” he told her brother. “Drogo
will be enraptured.”
“She’s too skinny,” Viserys said. His hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had been pulled
back tightly behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch. It was a severe
look that emphasized the hard, gaunt lines of his face. He rested his hand on the hilt of
the sword that Illyrio had lent him, and said, “Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his
women this young?”
“She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal,” Illyrio told him, not for the first
time. “Look at her. That silver-gold hair, those purple eyes . . . she is the blood of old
Valyria, no doubt, no doubt . . . and highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new,
she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo.” When he released her hand, Daenerys found
herself trembling.
“I suppose,” her brother said doubtfully. “The savages have queer tastes. Boys, horses,
sheep . . . ”
“Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo,” Illyrio said.
Anger flashed in her brother’s lilac eyes. “Do you take me for a fool?”
The magister bowed slightly. “I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common
men. My apologies if I have given offense.” He turned away and clapped his hands for
his bearers.
The streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in Illyrio’s elaborately carved
palanquin. Two servants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with
panes of pale blue glass, while a dozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders. It
was warm and close inside behind the curtains. Dany could smell the stench of Illyrio’s
pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes.
Her brother, sprawled out on his pillows beside her, never noticed. His mind was away
across the narrow sea. “We won’t need his whole khalasar,” Viserys said. His fingers
toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade, though Dany knew he had never used a sword
in earnest. “Ten thousand, that would be enough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms
with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will rise for its rightful king. Tyrell,
Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do. The
Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us.
They cry out for their king.” He looked at Illyrio anxiously. “They do, don’t they?”
“They are your people, and they love you well,” Magister Illyrio said amiably. “In
holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew
dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water.” He
gave a massive shrug. “Or so my agents tell me.”
Dany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the
narrow sea, but she mistrusted Illyrio’s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about
Illyrio. Her brother was nodding eagerly, however. “I shall kill the Usurper myself,” he
promised, who had never killed anyone, “as he killed my brother Rhaegar. And
Lannister too, the Kingslayer, for what he did to my father.”
“That would be most fitting,” Magister Illyrio said. Dany saw the smallest hint of a smile
playing around his full lips, but her brother did not notice. Nodding, he pushed back a
curtain and stared off into the night, and Dany knew he was fighting the Battle of the
Trident once again.
The nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo sat beside the waters of the bay, its high brick
walls overgrown with pale ivy. It had been given to the khal by the magisters of Pentos,
Illyrio told them. The Free Cities were always generous with the horselords. “It is not
that we fear these barbarians,” Illyrio would explain with a smile. “The Lord of Light
would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki, or so the red priests promise . . . yet
why take chances, when their friendship comes so cheap?”
Their palanquin was stopped at the gate, the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the
house guards. He had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a Dothraki, but his face
was hairless and he wore the spiked bronze cap of the Unsullied. He looked them over
coldly. Magister Illyrio growled something to him in the rough Dothraki tongue; the
guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the gates.
Dany noticed that her brother’s hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his
borrowed sword. He looked almost as frightened as she felt. “Insolent eunuch,” Viserys
muttered as the palanquin lurched up toward the manse.
Magister Illyrio’s words were honey. “Many important men will be at the feast tonight.
Such men have enemies. The khal must protect his guests, yourself chief among them,
Your Grace. No doubt the Usurper would pay well for your head.”
“Oh, yes,” Viserys said darkly. “He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that. His hired knives
follow us everywhere. I am the last dragon, and he will not sleep easy while I live.”
The palanquin slowed and stopped. The curtains were thrown back, and a slave offered a
hand to help Daenerys out. His collar, she noted, was ordinary bronze. Her brother
followed, one hand still clenched hard around his sword hilt. It took two strong men to
get Magister Illyrio back on his feet.
Inside the manse, the air was heavy with the scent of spices, pinchfire and sweet lemon
and cinnamon. They were escorted across the entry hall, where a mosaic of colored glass
depicted the Doom of Valyria. Oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls.
Beneath an arch of twining stone leaves, a eunuch sang their coming. “Viserys of the
House Targaryen, the Third of his Name,” he called in a high, sweet voice, “King of the
Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector
of the Realm. His sister, Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone. His honorable
host, Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of the Free City of Pentos.”
They stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy. Moonlight
painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them. Many
were Dothraki horselords, big men with red-brown skin, their drooping mustachios
bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and braided and hung with bells. Yet among
them moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and Myr and Tyrosh, a red priest even
fatter than Illyrio, hairy men from the Port of Ibben, and lords from the Summer Isles
with skin as black as ebony. Daenerys looked at them all in wonder . . . and realized, with
a sudden start of fear, that she was the only woman there.
Illyrio whispered to them. “Those three are Drogo’s bloodriders, there,” he said. “By the
pillar is Khal Moro, with his son Rhogoro. The man with the green beard is brother to
the Archon of Tyrosh, and the man behind him is Ser Jorah Mormont.”
The last name caught Daenerys. “A knight?”
“No less.” Illyrio smiled through his beard. “Anointed with the seven oils by the High
Septon himself.”
“What is he doing here?” she blurted.
“The Usurper wanted his head,” Illyrio told them. “Some trifling affront. He sold some
poachers to a Tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night’s Watch. Absurd law. A
man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel.”
“I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done,” her brother said. Dany
found herself looking at the knight curiously. He was an older man, past forty and
balding, but still strong and fit. Instead of silks and cottons, he wore wool and leather.
His tunic was a dark green, embroidered with the likeness of a black bear standing on
two legs.
She was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when
Magister Illyrio placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder. “Over there, sweet princess,”
he whispered, “there is the khal himself.”
Dany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she displeased
him she knew she would wake the dragon. Anxiously, she turned and looked at the man
Viserys hoped would ask to wed her before the night was done.
The slave girl had not been far wrong, she thought. Khal Drogo was a head taller than
the tallest man in the room, yet somehow light on his feet, as graceful as the panther in
Illyrio’s menagerie. He was younger than she’d thought, no more than thirty. His skin
was the color of polished copper, his thick mustachios bound with gold and bronze rings.
“I must go and make my submissions,” Magister Illyrio said. “Wait here. I shall bring
him to you.”
Her brother took her by the arm as Illyrio waddled over to the khal, his fingers
squeezing so hard that they hurt. “Do you see his braid, sweet sister?”
Drogo’s braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with tiny bells that
rang softly as he moved. It swung well past his belt, below even his buttocks, the end of it
brushing against the back of his thighs.
“You see how long it is?” Viserys said. “When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut
off their braids in disgrace, so the world will know their shame. Khal Drogo has never
lost a fight. He is Aegon the Dragonlord come again, and you will be his queen.”
Dany looked at Khal Drogo. His face was hard and cruel, his eyes as cold and dark as
onyx. Her brother hurt her sometimes, when she woke the dragon, but he did not
frighten her the way this man frightened her. “I don’t want to be his queen,” she heard
herself say in a small, thin voice. “Please, please, Viserys, I don’t want to, I want to go
home.”
“Home?” He kept his voice low, but she could hear the fury in his tone. “How are we to
go home, sweet sister? They took our home from us!” He drew her into the shadows, out
of sight, his fingers digging into her skin. “How are we to go home?” he repeated,
meaning King’s Landing, and Dragonstone, and all the realm they had lost.
Dany had only meant their rooms in Illyrio’s estate, no true home surely, though all they
had, but her brother did not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even
the big house with the red door had not been home for him. His fingers dug hard into
her arm, demanding an answer. “I don’t know . . . ”she said at last, her voice breaking.
Tears welled in her eyes.
“I do,” he said sharply. “We go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal Drogo’s
army, that is how we go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for that, you will.”
He smiled at her. “I’d let his whole khalasar fuck you if need be, sweet sister, all forty
thousand men, and their horses too if that was what it took to get my army. Be grateful it
is only Drogo. In time you may even learn to like him. Now dry your eyes. Illyrio is
bringing him over, and he will not see you crying.”
Dany turned and saw that it was true. Magister Illyrio, all smiles and bows, was
escorting Khal Drogo over to where they stood. She brushed away unfallen tears with the
back of her hand.
“Smile,” Viserys whispered nervously, his hand failing to the hilt of his sword. “And
stand up straight. Let him see that you have breasts. Gods know, you have little enough
as is.”
Daenerys smiled, and stood up straight.

EDDARD
The visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished
steel, three hundred strong, a pride of bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and
freeriders. Over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the
northern wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of Baratheon.
Ned knew many of the riders. There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as bright as
beaten gold, and there Sandor Clegane with his terrible burned face. The tall boy beside
him could only be the crown prince, and that stunted little man behind them was surely
the Imp, Tyrion Lannister.
Yet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the snow-white
cloaks of the Kingsguard, seemed almost a stranger to Ned . . . until he vaulted off the
back of his warhorse with a familiar roar, and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug.
“Ned! Ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of yours.” The king looked him over top to
bottom, and laughed. “You have not changed at all.”
Would that Ned had been able to say the same. Fifteen years past, when they had ridden
forth to win a throne, the Lord of Storm’s End had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and
muscled like a maiden’s fantasy. Six and a half feet tall, he towered over lesser men, and
when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his House, he became a
veritable giant. He’d had a giant’s strength too, his weapon of choice a spiked iron
warhammer that Ned could scarcely lift. In those days, the smell of leather and blood
had clung to him like perfume.
Now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to match his
height. Ned had last seen the king nine years before during Balon Greyjoy’s rebellion,
when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed
King of the Iron Islands. Since the night they had stood side by side in Greyjoy’s fallen
stronghold, where Robert had accepted the rebel lord’s surrender and Ned had taken his
son Theon as hostage and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone. A beard as
coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the
royal jowls, but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes.
Yet Robert was Ned’s king now, and not just a friend, so he said only, “Your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.”
By then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming forward for their
mounts. Robert’s queen, Cersei Lannister, entered on foot with her younger children.
The wheelhouse in which they had ridden, a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak
and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses, was too wide to pass through the
castle gate. Ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen’s ring, while Robert embraced
Catelyn like a long-lost sister. Then the children had been brought forward, introduced,
and approved of by both sides.
No sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his
host, “Take me down to your crypt, Eddard. I would pay my respects.”
Ned loved him for that, for remembering her still after all these years. He called for a
lantern. No other words were needed. The queen had begun to protest. They had been
riding since dawn, everyone was tired and cold, surely they should refresh themselves
first. The dead would wait. She had said no more than that; Robert had looked at her,
and her twin brother Jaime had taken her quietly by the arm, and she had said no more.
They went down to the crypt together, Ned and this king he scarcely recognized. The
winding stone steps were narrow. Ned went first with the lantern. “I was starting to
think we would never reach Winterfell,” Robert complained as they descended. “In the
south, the way they talk about my Seven Kingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big
as the other six combined.”
“I trust you enjoyed the journey, Your Grace?”
Robert snorted. “Bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent inn north of the
Neck. I’ve never seen such a vast emptiness. Where are all your people?”
“Likely they were too shy to come out,” Ned jested. He could feel the chill coming up the
stairs, a cold breath from deep within the earth. “Kings are a rare sight in the north.”
Robert snorted. “More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!” The king
put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended.
“Late summer snows are common enough,” Ned said. “I hope they did not trouble you.
They are usually mild.”
“The Others take your mild snows,” Robert swore. “What will this place be like in
winter? I shudder to think.”
“The winters are hard,” Ned admitted. “But the Starks will endure. We always have.”
“You need to come south,” Robert told him. “You need a taste of summer before it flees.
In Highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see.
The fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouth—melons, peaches, fireplums, you’ve
never tasted such sweetness. You’ll see, I brought you some. Even at Storm’s End, with
that good wind off the bay, the days are so hot you can barely move. And you ought to
see the towns, Ned! Flowers everywhere, the markets bursting with food, the
summerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air.
Everyone is fat and drunk and rich.” He laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a
thump. “And the girls, Ned!” he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. “I swear, women lose all
modesty in the heat. They swim naked in the river, right beneath the castle. Even in the
streets, it’s too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in these short gowns, silk if
they have the silver and cotton if not, but it’s all the same when they start sweating and
the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked.” The king laughed happily.
Robert Baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites, a man who knew how to
take his pleasures. That was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of Eddard Stark.
Yet Ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king.
Robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs, his face
red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt.
“Your Grace,” Ned said respectfully. He swept the lantern in a wide semicircle. Shadows
moved and lurched. Flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a
long procession of granite pillars that marched ahead, two by two, into the dark.
Between the pillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against
the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains. “She is down at the end, with Father
and Brandon.”
He led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly, shivering in the
subterranean chill. It was always cold down here. Their footsteps rang off the stones and
echoed in the vault overhead as they walked among the dead of House Stark. The Lords
of Winterfell watched them pass. Their likenesses were carved into the stones that sealed
the tombs. In long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness, while great
stone direwolves curled round their feet. The shifting shadows made the stone figures
seem to stir as the living passed by.
By ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been
Lord of Winterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts. The oldest had long ago
rusted away to nothing, leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on
stone. Ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now. He
hoped not. The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled. In the
centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea, they had sworn allegiance to no
man, styling themselves the Kings in the North.
Ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness
ahead of them, but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes
waiting for their dead, waiting for him and his children. Ned did not like to think on
that. “Here,” he told his king.
Robert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed his head.
There were three tombs, side by side. Lord Rickard Stark, Ned’s father, had a long, stern
face. The stonemason had known him well. He sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers
holding tight to the sword across his lap, but in life all swords had failed him. In two
smaller sepulchres on either side were his children.
Brandon had been twenty when he died, strangled by order of the Mad King Aerys
Targaryen only a few short days before he was to wed Catelyn Tully of Riverrun. His
father had been forced to watch him die. He was the true heir, the eldest, born to rule.
Lyanna had only been sixteen, a child-woman of surpassing loveliness. Ned had loved
her with all his heart. Robert had loved her even more. She was to have been his bride.
“She was more beautiful than that,” the king said after a silence. His eyes lingered on
Lyanna’s face, as if he could will her back to life. Finally he rose, made awkward by his
weight. “Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?” His voice was
hoarse with remembered grief. “She deserved more than darkness . . . ”
“She was a Stark of Winterfell,” Ned said quietly. “This is her place.”
“She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and clouds above
her and the rain to wash her clean.”
“I was with her when she died,” Ned reminded the king. “She wanted to come home, to
rest beside Brandon and Father.” He could hear her still at times. Promise me, she had
cried, in a room that smelled of blood and roses. Promise me, Ned. The fever had taken
her strength and her voice had been faint as a whisper, but when he gave her his word,
the fear had gone out of his sister’s eyes. Ned remembered the way she had smiled then,
how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose petals
spilling from her palm, dead and black. After that he remembered nothing. They had
found him still holding her body, silent with grief. The little crannogman, Howland
Reed, had taken her hand from his. Ned could recall none of it. “I bring her flowers when
I can,” he said. “Lyanna was . . . fond of flowers.”
The king touched her cheek, his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it
were living flesh. “I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her.”
“You did,” Ned reminded him.
“Only once,” Robert said bitterly.
They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the battle crashed around them,
Robert with his warhammer and his great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored
all in black. On his breastplate was the three-headed dragon of his House, wrought all in
rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight. The waters of the Trident ran red around the
hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again and again, until at last a
crushing blow from Robert’s hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it.
When Ned had finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of
both armies scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor.
“In my dreams, I kill him every night,” Robert admitted. “A thousand deaths will still be
less than he deserves.”
There was nothing Ned could say to that. After a quiet, he said, “We should return, Your
Grace. Your wife will be waiting.”
“The Others take my wife,” Robert muttered sourly, but he started back the way they had
come, his footsteps falling heavily. “And if I hear ‘Your Grace’ once more, I’ll have your
head on a spike. We are more to each other than that.”
“I had not forgotten,” Ned replied quietly. When the king did not answer, he said, “Tell
me about Jon.”
Robert shook his head. “I have never seen a man sicken so quickly. We gave a tourney on
my son’s name day. If you had seen Jon then, you would have sworn he would live
forever. A fortnight later he was dead. The sickness was like a fire in his gut. It burned
right through him.” He paused beside a pillar, before the tomb of a long-dead Stark. “I
loved that old man.”
“We both did.” Ned paused a moment. “Catelyn fears for her sister. How does Lysa bear
her grief?”
Robert’s mouth gave a bitter twist. “Not well, in truth,” he admitted. “I think losing Jon
has driven the woman mad, Ned. She has taken the boy back to the Eyrie. Against my
wishes. I had hoped to foster him with Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock. Jon had no
brothers, no other sons. Was I supposed to leave him to be raised by women?”
Ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin, but he left his doubts
unspoken. Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. “The
wife has lost the husband,” he said carefully. “Perhaps the mother feared to lose the son.
The boy is very young.”
“Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy,” the king swore. “Lord Tywin
had never taken a ward before. Lysa ought to have been honored. The Lannisters are a
great and noble House. She refused to even hear of it. Then she left in the dead of night,
without so much as a by-your-leave. Cersei was furious.” He sighed deeply. “The boy is
my namesake, did you know that? Robert Arryn. I am sworn to protect him. How can I
do that if his mother steals him away?”
“I will take him as ward, if you wish,” Ned said. “Lysa should consent to that. She and
Catelyn were close as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.”
“A generous offer, my friend,” the king said, “but too late. Lord Tywin has already given
his consent. Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.”
“I have more concern for my nephew’s welfare than I do for Lannister pride,” Ned
declared.
“That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister.” Robert laughed, the sound rattling
among the tombs and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling. His smile was a flash of white
teeth in the thicket of the huge black beard. “Ah, Ned,” he said, “you are still too
serious.” He put a massive arm around Ned’s shoulders. “I had planned to wait a few
days to speak to you, but I see now there’s no need for it. Come, walk with me.”
They started back down between the pillars. Blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as
they passed. The king kept his arm around Ned’s shoulder. “You must have wondered
why I finally came north to Winterfell, after so long.”
Ned had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice. “For the joy of my company,
surely,” he said lightly. “And there is the Wall. You need to see it, Your Grace, to walk
along its battlements and talk to those who man it. The Night’s Watch is a shadow of
what it once was. Benjen says—”
“No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,” Robert said. “The Wall has
stood for what, eight thousand years? It can keep a few days more. I have more pressing
concerns. These are difficult times. I need good men about me. Men like Jon Arryn. He
served as Lord of the Eyrie, as Warden of the East, as the Hand of the King. He will not
be easy to replace.”
“His son . . . ” Ned began.
“His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes,” Robert said brusquely. “No more.”
That took Ned by surprise. He stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king. The
words came unbidden. “The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East. The title goes
with the domain.”
“Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,” Robert said. “I have
this year to think of, and next. A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Ned.”
“In peace, the title is only an honor. Let the boy keep it. For his father’s sake if not his
own. Surely you owe Jon that much for his service.”
The king was not pleased. He took his arm from around Ned’s shoulders. “Jon’s service
was the duty he owed his liege lord. I am not ungrateful, Ned. You of all men ought to
know that. But the son is not the father. A mere boy cannot hold the east.” Then his tone
softened. “Enough of this. There is a more important office to discuss, and I would not
argue with you.” Robert grasped Ned by the elbow. “I have need of you, Ned.”
“I am yours to command, Your Grace. Always.” They were words he had to say, and so he
said them, apprehensive about what might come next.
Robert scarcely seemed to hear him. “Those years we spent in the Eyrie . . . gods, those
were good years. I want you at my side again, Ned. I want you down in King’s Landing,
not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody.” Robert
looked off into the darkness, for a moment as melancholy as a Stark. “I swear to you,
sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one. Laws are a tedious
business and counting coppers is worse. And the people . . . there is no end of them. I sit
on that damnable iron chair and listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my
ass is raw. They all want something, money or land or justice. The lies they tell . . . and
my lords and ladies are no better. I am surrounded by flatterers and fools. It can drive a
man to madness, Ned. Half of them don’t dare tell me the truth, and the other half can’t
find it. There are nights I wish we had lost at the Trident. Ah, no, not truly, but . . .
“I understand,” Ned said softly.
Robert looked at him. “I think you do. If so, you are the only one, my old friend.” He
smiled. “Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.”
Ned dropped to one knee. The offer did not surprise him; what other reason could
Robert have had for coming so far? The Hand of the King was the second-most powerful
man in the Seven Kingdoms. He spoke with the king’s voice, commanded the king’s
armies, drafted the king’s laws. At times he even sat upon the Iron Throne to dispense
king’s justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or otherwise indisposed. Robert was
offering him a responsibility as large as the realm itself.
It was the last thing in the world he wanted.
“Your Grace,” he said. “I am not worthy of the honor.”
Robert groaned with good-humored impatience. “If I wanted to honor you, I’d let you
retire. I am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I eat and
drink and wench myself into an early grave.” He slapped his gut and grinned. “You know
the saying, about the king and his Hand?”
Ned knew the saying. “What the king dreams,” he said, “the Hand builds.”
“I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it. The
king eats, they say, and the Hand takes the shit.” He threw back his head and roared his
laughter. The echoes rang through the darkness, and all around them the dead of
Winterfell seemed to watch with cold and disapproving eyes.
Finally the laughter dwindled and stopped. Ned was still on one knee, his eyes upraised.
“Damn it, Ned,” the king complained. “You might at least humor me with a smile.”
“They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man’s laughter freezes in his throat
and chokes him to death,” Ned said evenly. “Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little
humor.”
“Come south with me, and I’ll teach you how to laugh again,” the king promised. “You
helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold it. We were meant to rule
together. If Lyanna had lived, we should have been brothers, bound by blood as well as
affection. Well, it is not too late. I have a son. You have a daughter. My Joff and your
Sansa shall join our houses, as Lyanna and I might once have done.”
This offer did surprise him. “Sansa is only eleven.”
Robert waved an impatient hand. “Old enough for betrothal. The marriage can wait a
few years.” The king smiled. “Now stand up and say yes, curse you.”
“Nothing would give me greater pleasure, Your Grace,” Ned answered. He hesitated.
“These honors are all so unexpected. May I have some time to consider? I need to tell my
wife . . . ”
“Yes, yes, of course, tell Catelyn, sleep on it if you must.” The king reached down, clasped
Ned by the hand, and pulled him roughly to his feet. “Just don’t keep me waiting too
long. I am not the most patient of men.”
For a moment Eddard Stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding. This was his
place, here in the north. He looked at the stone figures all around them, breathed deep
in the chill silence of the crypt. He could feel the eyes of the dead. They were all
listening, he knew. And winter was coming.

JON
There were times—not many, but a few—when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard. As
he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be
one of them.
He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank. The
sweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips.
The Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted
meat and fresh-baked bread. Its grey stone walls were draped with banners. White, gold,
crimson: the direwolf of Stark, Baratheon’s crowned stag, the lion of Lannister. A singer
was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice
could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups,
and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.
It was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king. Jon’s brothers and sisters
had been seated with the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and
Lady Stark hosted the king and queen. In honor of the occasion, his lord father would
doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no more than that. Down here on the
benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for.
And he was finding that he had a man’s thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths
around him, who urged him on every time he drained a glass. They were fine company,
and Jon relished the stories they were telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt.
He was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the king’s offspring.
He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance. The
procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon
had gotten a good long look at them all.
His lord father had come first, escorting the queen. She was as beautiful as men said. A
jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the
green of her eyes. His father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat,
but the queen never so much as looked at him. Even at fourteen, Jon could see through
her smile.
Next had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm. The king was a great
disappointment to Jon. His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert
Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among
princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through his silks.
He walked like a man half in his cups.
After them came the children. Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the
dignity a three-year-old could muster. Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit.
Close behind came Robb, in grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors. He had the
Princess Myrcella on his arm. She was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade
of golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the shy looks she gave Robb as they
passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him. He decided she was
insipid. Robb didn’t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning
like a fool.
His half sisters escorted the royal princes. Arya was paired with plump young Tommen,
whose white-blond hair was longer than hers. Sansa, two years older, drew the crown
prince, Joffrey Baratheon. He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than
either, to Jon’s vast dismay. Prince Joffrey had his sister’s hair and his mother’s deep
green eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high
velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon did not like
Joffrey’s pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell’s Great Hall.
He was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen’s brothers, the
Lannisters of Casterly Rock. The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was
which. Ser Jaime Lannister was twin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with flashing
green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. He wore crimson silk, high black boots, a
black satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was embroidered in
gold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and
whispered “Kingslayer” behind his back.
Jon found it hard to look away from him. This is what a king should look like, he
thought to himself as the man passed.
Then he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother’s side. Tyrion
Lannister, the youngest of Lord Tywin’s brood and by far the ugliest. All that the gods
had given to Cersei and Jaime, they had denied Tyrion. He was a dwarf, half his
brother’s height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. His head was too large for his
body, with a brute’s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow. One green eye and
one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white. Jon
watched him with fascination.
The last of the high lords to enter were his uncle, Benjen Stark of the Night’s Watch, and
his father’s ward, young Theon Greyjoy. Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as he went by.
Theon ignored him utterly, but there was nothing new in that. After all had been seated,
toasts were made, thanks were given and returned, and then the feasting began.
Jon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped.
Something rubbed against his leg beneath the table. Jon saw red eyes staring up at him.
“Hungry again?” he asked. There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the
table. Jon reached out to tear off a leg, then had a better idea. He knifed the bird whole
and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs. Ghost ripped into it in savage
silence. His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the
banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no
one had said a word about his pup. He told himself he was fortunate in that too.
His eyes stung. Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. He swallowed another
gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken.
Dogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls. One of them, a black
mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. She stopped and
edged under the bench to get a share. Jon watched the confrontation. The bitch growled
low in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up, silent, and fixed the dog with those
hot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry challenge. She was three times the size of the
direwolf pup. Ghost did not move. He stood over his prize and opened his mouth, baring
his fangs. The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought better of this fight. She turned
and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride. Ghost went back to his
meal.
Jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur. The direwolf
looked up at him, nipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating.
“Is this one of the direwolves I’ve heard so much of?” a familiar voice asked close at hand.
Jon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much
as Jon had ruffled the wolf’s. “Yes,” he said. “His name is Ghost.”
One of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he’d been telling to make room at the
table for their lord’s brother. Benjen Stark straddled the bench with long legs and took
the wine cup out of Jon’s hand. “Summerwine,” he said after a taste. “Nothing so sweet.
How many cups have you had, Jon?”
Jon smiled.
Ben Stark laughed. “As I feared. Ah, well. I believe I was younger than you the first time
I got truly and sincerely drunk.” He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy,
from a nearby trencher and bit into it. It crunched.
His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint
of laughter in his blue-grey eyes. He dressed in black, as befitted a man of the Night’s
Watch. Tonight it was rich black velvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a
silver buckle. A heavy silver chain was looped round his neck. Benjen watched Ghost
with amusement as he ate his onion. “A very quiet wolf,” he observed.
“He’s not like the others,” Jon said. “He never makes a sound. That’s why I named him
Ghost. That, and because he’s white. The others are all dark, grey or black.”
“There are still direwolves beyond the Wall. We hear them on our rangings.” Benjen
Stark gave Jon a long look. “Don’t you usually eat at table with your brothers?”
“Most times,” Jon answered in a flat voice. “But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give
insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them.”
“I see.” His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall.
“My brother does not seem very festive tonight.”
Jon had noticed that too. A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that
people hid behind their eyes. His father was observing all the courtesies, but there was
tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before. He said little, looking out over the hall
with hooded eyes, seeing nothing. Two seats away, the king had been drinking heavily all
night. His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard. He made many a toast,
laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him
the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture. “The queen is angry too,” Jon told his
uncle in a low, quiet voice. “Father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon. The
queen didn’t want him to go.”
Benjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look. “You don’t miss much, do you, Jon? We
could use a man like you on the Wall.”
Jon swelled with pride. “Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I’m the better sword,
and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.”
“Notable achievements.”
“Take me with you when you go back to the Wall,” Jon said in a sudden rush. “Father
will give me leave to go if you ask him, I know he will.”
Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully. “The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.”
“I am almost a man grown,” Jon protested. “I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and
Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children.”
“That’s true enough,” Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth. He took Jon’s
cup from the table, filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow.
“Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,” Jon said. The Young
Dragon was one of his heroes.
“A conquest that lasted a summer,” his uncle pointed out. “Your Boy King lost ten
thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold it. Someone should have
told him that war isn’t a game.” He took another sip of wine. “Also,” he said, wiping his
mouth, “Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died. Or have you forgotten that
part?”
“I forget nothing,” Jon boasted. The wine was making him bold. He tried to sit very
straight, to make himself seem taller. “I want to serve in the Night’s Watch, Uncle.”
He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around
him. Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the
Warden of the North. Bran and Rickon would be Robb’s bannermen and rule holdfasts
in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and
go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn?
“You don’t know what you’re asking, Jon. The Night’s Watch is a sworn brotherhood. We
have no families. None of us will ever father sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is
honor.”
“A bastard can have honor too,” Jon said. “I am ready to swear your oath.”
“You are a boy of fourteen,” Benjen said. “Not a man, not yet. Until you have known a
woman, you cannot understand what you would be giving up.”
“I don’t care about that!” Jon said hotly.
“You might, if you knew what it meant,” Benjen said. “If you knew what the oath would
cost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son.”
Jon felt anger rise inside him. “I’m not your son!”
Benjen Stark stood up. “More’s the pity.” He put a hand on Jon’s shoulder. “Come back
to me after you’ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we’ll see how you feel.”
Jon trembled. “I will never father a bastard,” he said carefully. “Never!” He spat it out
like venom.
Suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him. He
felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes. He pushed himself to his feet.
“I must be excused,” he said with the last of his dignity. He whirled and bolted before
they could see him cry. He must have drunk more wine than he had realized. His feet got
tangled under him as he tried to leave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and
sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor. Laughter boomed all around him, and
Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks. Someone tried to steady him. He wrenched free of their
grip and ran, half-blind, for the door. Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the night.
The yard was quiet and empty. A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner
wall, his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold. He looked bored and miserable
as he huddled there alone, but Jon would have traded places with him in an instant.
Otherwise the castle was dark and deserted. Jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once, a
drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever
people had lived there. Winterfell reminded him of that tonight.
The sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him. They were
the last things Jon wanted to hear. He wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt,
furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go.
“Boy,” a voice called out to him. Jon turned.
Tyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all
the world like a gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down at him. “Is that animal a wolf?”
“A direwolf,” Jon said. “His name is Ghost.” He stared up at the little man, his
disappointment suddenly forgotten. “What are you doing up there? Why aren’t you at
the feast?”
“Too hot, too noisy, and I’d drunk too much wine,” the dwarf told him. “I learned long
ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother. Might I have a closer look at your
wolf?”
Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly. “Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder?”
“Oh, bleed that,” the little man said. He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air. Jon
gasped, then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed
lightly on his hands, then vaulted backward onto his legs.
Ghost backed away from him uncertainly.
The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed. “I believe I’ve frightened your wolf. My
apologies.”
“He’s not scared,” Jon said. He knelt and called out. “Ghost, come here. Come on. That’s
it.”
The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon’s face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion
Lannister, and when the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs
in a silent snarl. “Shy, isn’t he?” Lannister observed.
“Sit, Ghost,” Jon commanded. “That’s it. Keep still.” He looked up at the dwarf. “You can
touch him now. He won’t move until I tell him to. I’ve been training him.”
“I see,” Lannister said. He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost’s ears and said,
“Nice wolf.”
“If I wasn’t here, he’d tear out your throat,” Jon said. It wasn’t actually true yet, but it
would be.
“In that case, you had best stay close,” the dwarf said. He cocked his oversized head to
one side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes. “I am Tyrion Lannister.”
“I know,” Jon said. He rose. Standing, he was taller than the dwarf. It made him feel
strange.
“You’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?”
Jon felt a coldness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and said nothing.
“Did I offend you?” Lannister said. “Sorry. Dwarfs don’t have to be tactful. Generations
of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing
that comes into my head.” He grinned. “You are the bastard, though.”
“Lord Eddard Stark is my father,” Jon admitted stiffly.
Lannister studied his face. “Yes,” he said. “I can see it. You have more of the north in you
than your brothers.”
“Half brothers,” Jon corrected. He was pleased by the dwarf’s comment, but he tried not
to let it show.
“Let me give you some counsel, bastard,” Lannister said. “Never forget what you are, for
surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness.
Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.”
Jon was in no mood for anyone’s counsel. “What do you know about being a bastard?”
“All dwarfs are bastards in their father’s eyes.”
“You are your mother’s trueborn son of Lannister.”
“Am I?” the dwarf replied, sardonic. “Do tell my lord father. My mother died birthing
me, and he’s never been sure.”
“I don’t even know who my mother was,” Jon said.
“Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are.” He favored Jon with a rueful grin.
“Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.”
And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune. When he
opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for
just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king.

CATELYN
Of all the rooms in Winterfell’s Great Keep, Catelyn’s bedchambers were the hottest. She
seldom had to light a fire. The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the
scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man’s body,
driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth,
keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small
courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between
life and death.
Catelyn’s bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. The
warmth reminded her of Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, but Ned
could never abide the heat. The Starks were made for the cold, he would tell her, and she
would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong
place.
So when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a
thousand times before. He crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, and threw
open the high narrow windows one by one, letting the night air into the chamber.
The wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, naked and empty-handed.
Catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him. He looked somehow smaller and
more vulnerable, like the youth she had wed in the sept at Riverrun, fifteen long years
gone. Her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovemaking. It was a good ache. She
could feel his seed within her. She prayed that it might quicken there. It had been three
years since Rickon. She was not too old. She could give him another son.
“I will refuse him,” Ned said as he turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, his voice
thick with doubt.
Catelyn sat up in the bed. “You cannot. You must not.”
“My duties are here in the north. I have no wish to be Robert’s Hand.”
“He will not understand that. He is a king now, and kings are not like other men. If you
refuse to serve him, he will wonder why, and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that
you oppose him. Can’t you see the danger that would put us in?”
Ned shook his head, refusing to believe. “Robert would never harm me or any of mine.
We were closer than brothers. He loves me. If I refuse him, he will roar and curse and
bluster, and in a week we will laugh about it together. I know the man!”
“You knew the man,” she said. “The king is a stranger to you.” Catelyn remembered the
direwolf dead in the snow, the broken antler lodged deep in her throat. She had to make
him see. “Pride is everything to a king, my lord. Robert came all this way to see you, to
bring you these great honors, you cannot throw them back in his face.”
“Honors?” Ned laughed bitterly.
“In his eyes, yes,” she said.
“And in yours?”
“And in mine,” she blazed, angry now. Why couldn’t he see? “He offers his own son in
marriage to our daughter, what else would you call that? Sansa might someday be queen.
Her sons could rule from the Wall to the mountains of Dorne. What is so wrong with
that?”
“Gods, Catelyn, Sansa is only eleven,” Ned said. “And Joffrey . . . Joffrey is . . . ”
She finished for him. “ . . . crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne. And I was only
twelve when my father promised me to your brother Brandon.”
That brought a bitter twist to Ned’s mouth. “Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to
do. He always did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was
born to be a King’s Hand and a father to queens. I never asked for this cup to pass to me.”
“Perhaps not,” Catelyn said, “but Brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, and you must
drink from it, like it or not.”
Ned turned away from her, back to the night. He stood staring out in the darkness,
watching the moon and the stars perhaps, or perhaps the sentries on the wall.
Catelyn softened then, to see his pain. Eddard Stark had married her in Brandon’s place,
as custom decreed, but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them, as did the
other, the shadow of the woman he would not name, the woman who had borne him his
bastard son.
She was about to go to him when the knock came at the door, loud and unexpected. Ned
turned, frowning. “What is it?”
Desmond’s voice came through the door. “My lord, Maester Luwin is without and begs
urgent audience.”
“You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?”
“Yes, my lord. He insists.”
“Very well. Send him in.”
Ned crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe. Catelyn realized suddenly how
cold it had become. She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin. “Perhaps we should
close the windows,” she suggested.
Ned nodded absently. Maester Luwin was shown in.
The maester was a small grey man. His eyes were grey, and quick, and saw much. His
hair was grey, what little the years had left him. His robe was grey wool, trimmed with
white fur, the Stark colors. Its great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside. Luwin was
always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them: books,
messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children. With all he kept hidden in his sleeves,
Catelyn was surprised that Maester Luwin could lift his arms at all.
The maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke. “My lord,” he
said to Ned, “pardon for disturbing your rest. I have been left a message.”
Ned looked irritated. “Been left? By whom? Has there been a rider? I was not told.”
“There was no rider, my lord. Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my
observatory while I napped. My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by
someone in the king’s party. We have had no other visitors from the south.”
“A wooden box, you say?” Catelyn said.
“Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it. The
lenscrafters of Myr are without equal.”
Ned frowned. He had little patience for this sort of thing, Catelyn knew. “A lens,” he said.
“What has that to do with me?”
“I asked the same question,” Maester Luwin said. “Clearly there was more to this than
the seeming.”
Under the heavy weight of her furs, Catelyn shivered. “A lens is an instrument to help us
see.”
“Indeed it is.” He fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight around the
neck beneath his robe, each link forged from a different metal.
Catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again. “What is it that they would have
us see more clearly?”
“The very thing I asked myself.” Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his
sleeve. “I found the true message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the
box the lens had come in, but it is not for my eyes.”
Ned held out his hand. “Let me have it, then.”
Luwin did not stir. “Pardons, my lord. The message is not for you either. It is marked for
the eyes of the Lady Catelyn, and her alone. May I approach?”
Catelyn nodded, not trusting to speak. The maester placed the paper on the table beside
the bed. It was sealed with a small blob of blue wax. Luwin bowed and began to retreat.
“Stay,” Ned commanded him. His voice was grave. He looked at Catelyn. “What is it? My
lady, you’re shaking.”
“I’m afraid,” she admitted. She reached out and took the letter in trembling hands. The
furs dropped away from her nakedness, forgotten. In the blue wax was the moon-and-
falcon seal of House Arryn. “It’s from Lysa.” Catelyn looked at her husband. “It will not
make us glad,” she told him. “There is grief in this message, Ned. I can feel it.”
Ned frowned, his face darkening. “Open it.”
Catelyn broke the seal.
Her eyes moved over the words. At first they made no sense to her. Then she
remembered. “Lysa took no chances. When we were girls together, we had a private
language, she and I.”
“Can you read it?”
“Yes,” Catelyn admitted.
“Then tell us.”
“Perhaps I should withdraw,” Maester Luwin said.
“No,” Catelyn said. “We will need your counsel.” She threw back the furs and climbed
from the bed. The night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded
across the room.
Maester Luwin averted his eyes. Even Ned looked shocked. “What are you doing?” he
asked.
“Lighting a fire,” Catelyn told him. She found a dressing gown and shrugged into it, then
knelt over the cold hearth.
“Maester Luwin—” Ned began.
“Maester Luwin has delivered all my children,” Catelyn said. “This is no time for false
modesty.” She slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of
it.
Ned crossed the room, took her by the arm, and pulled her to her feet. He held her there,
his face inches from her. “My lady, tell me! What was this message?”
Catelyn stiffened in his grasp. “A warning,” she said softly. “If we have the wits to hear.”
His eyes searched her face. “Go on.”
“Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.”
His fingers tightened on her arm. “By whom?”
“The Lannisters,” she told him. “The queen.”
Ned released his hold on her arm. There were deep red marks on her skin. “Gods,” he
whispered. His voice was hoarse. “Your sister is sick with grief. She cannot know what
she is saying.”
“She knows,” Catelyn said. “Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully
planned, cleverly hidden. She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands.
To risk so much, she must have had more than mere suspicion.” Catelyn looked to her
husband. “Now we truly have no choice. You must be Robert’s Hand. You must go south
with him and learn the truth.”
She saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion. “The only truths I
know are here. The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.”
Luwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat. “The
Hand of the King has great power, my lord. Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn’s
death, to bring his killers to the king’s justice. Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son,
if the worst be true.”
Ned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber. Catelyn’s heart went out to him, but she
knew she could not take him in her arms just then. First the victory must be won, for her
children’s sake. “You say you love Robert like a brother. Would you leave your brother
surrounded by Lannisters?”
“The Others take both of you,” Ned muttered darkly. He turned away from them and
went to the window. She did not speak, nor did the maester. They waited, quiet, while
Eddard Stark said a silent farewell to the home he loved. When he turned away from the
window at last, his voice was tired and full of melancholy, and moisture glittered faintly
in the corners of his eyes. “My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king.
He never came home again.”
“A different time,” Maester Luwin said. “A different king.”
“Yes,” Ned said dully. He seated himself in a chair by the hearth. “Catelyn, you shall stay
here in Winterfell.”
His words were like an icy draft through her heart. “No,” she said, suddenly afraid. Was
this to be her punishment? Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her?
“Yes,” Ned said, in words that would brook no argument. “You must govern the north in
my stead, while I run Robert’s errands. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. Robb
is fourteen. Soon enough, he will be a man grown. He must learn to rule, and I will not
be here for him. Make him part of your councils. He must be ready when his time
comes.”
“Gods will, not for many years,” Maester Luwin murmured.
“Maester Luwin, I trust you as I would my own blood. Give my wife your voice in all
things great and small. Teach my son the things he needs to know. Winter is coming.”
Maester Luwin nodded gravely. Then silence fell, until Catelyn found her courage and
asked the question whose answer she most dreaded. “What of the other children?”
Ned stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his. “Rickon is very
young,” he said gently. “He should stay here with you and Robb. The others I would take
with me.”
“I could not bear it,” Catelyn said, trembling.
“You must,” he said. “Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no
grounds to suspect our devotion. And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a
southron court. In a few years she will be of an age to marry too.”
Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya
needed refinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never
Bran. “Yes,” she said, “but please, Ned, for the love you bear me, let Bran remain here at
Winterfell. He is only seven.”
“I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie,” Ned said. “Ser Rodrik tells
me there is bad feeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey. That is not healthy. Bran can
bridge that distance. He is a sweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love. Let him grow up
with the young princes, let him become their friend as Robert became mine. Our House
will be the safer for it.”
He was right; Catelyn knew it. It did not make the pain any easier to bear. She would
lose all four of them, then: Ned, and both girls, and her sweet, loving Bran. Only Robb
and little Rickon would be left to her. She felt lonely already. Winterfell was such a vast
place. “Keep him off the walls, then,” she said bravely. “You know how Bran loves to
climb.”
Ned kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall. “Thank you, my lady,” he
whispered. “This is hard, I know.”
“What of Jon Snow, my lord?” Maester Luwin asked.
Catelyn tensed at the mention of the name. Ned felt the anger in her, and pulled away.
Many men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no
surprise to her, in the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child
on some girl chance met on campaign. He had a man’s needs, after all, and they had
spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her father’s
castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at her breast, than of the
husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find between
battles. And if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child’s needs.
He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard
home with him, and called him “son” for all the north to see. When the wars were over at
last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up
residence.
That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle
has no secrets, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of
her husband’s soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning,
deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys’s Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had
slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur’s
sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on
the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting
violet eyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one
night, Catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it, asked him to his face.
That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. “Never ask me
about Jon,” he said, cold as ice. “He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And
now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady.” She had pledged to obey; she told
him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and Ashara Dayne’s name was
never heard in Winterfell again.
Whoever Jon’s mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn
said would persuade him to send the boy away. It was the one thing she could never
forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but she had never
found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned’s sake,
so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked
more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse.
“Jon must go,” she said now.
“He and Robb are close,” Ned said. “I had hoped . . . ”
“He cannot stay here,” Catelyn said, cutting him off. “He is your son, not mine. I will not
have him.” It was hard, she knew, but no less the truth. Ned would do the boy no
kindness by leaving him here at Winterfell.
The look Ned gave her was anguished. “You know I cannot take him south. There will be
no place for him at court. A boy with a bastard’s name . . . you know what they will say of
him. He will be shunned.”
Catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband’s eyes. “They say
your friend Robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself.”
“And none of them has ever been seen at court!” Ned blazed. “The Lannister woman has
seen to that. How can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a boy. He—”
His fury was on him. He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin cut in.
“Another solution presents itself,” he said, his voice quiet. “Your brother Benjen came to
me about Jon a few days ago. It seems the boy aspires to take the black.”
Ned looked shocked. “He asked to join the Night’s Watch?”
Catelyn said nothing. Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be
welcome now. Yet gladly would she have kissed the maester just then. His was the
perfect solution. Benjen Stark was a Sworn Brother. Jon would be a son to him, the child
he would never have. And in time the boy would take the oath as well. He would father
no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn’s own grandchildren for Winterfell.
Maester Luwin said, “There is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.”
“And even a bastard may rise high in the Night’s Watch,” Ned reflected. Still, his voice
was troubled. “Jon is so young. If he asked this when he was a man grown, that would be
one thing, but a boy of fourteen . . . ”
“A hard sacrifice,” Maester Luwin agreed. “Yet these are hard times, my lord. His road is
no crueler than yours or your lady’s.”
Catelyn thought of the three children she must lose. It was not easy keeping silent then.
Ned turned away from them to gaze out the window, his long face silent and thoughtful.
Finally he sighed, and turned back. “Very well,” he said to Maester Luwin. “I suppose it
is for the best. I will speak to Ben.”
“When shall we tell Jon?” the maester asked.
“When I must. Preparations must be made. It will be a fortnight before we are ready to
depart. I would sooner let Jon enjoy these last few days. Summer will end soon enough,
and childhood as well. When the time comes, I will tell him myself.”

ARYA
Arya’s stitches were crooked again.
She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat
among the other girls. Sansa’s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. “Sansa’s
work is as pretty as she is,” Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. “She has such
fine, delicate hands.” When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed.
“Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.”
Arya glanced furtively across the room, worried that Septa Mordane might have read her
thoughts, but the septa was paying her no attention today. She was sitting with the
Princess Myrcella, all smiles and admiration. It was not often that the septa was
privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts, as she had said when the
queen brought Myrcella to join them. Arya thought that Myrcella’s stitches looked a little
crooked too, but you would never know it from the way Septa Mordane was cooing.
She studied her own work again, looking for some way to salvage it, then sighed and put
down the needle. She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she
worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik’s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every
word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.
“What are you talking about?” Arya asked suddenly.
Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one
answered.
“Tell me,” Arya said.
Jeyne glanced over to make certain that Septa Mordane was not listening. Myrcella said
something then, and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies.
“We were talking about the prince,” Sansa said, her voice soft as a kiss.
Arya knew which prince she meant: Jofftey, of course. The tall, handsome one. Sansa got
to sit with him at the feast. Arya had to sit with the little fat one. Naturally.
“Joffrey likes your sister,” Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it.
She was the daughter of Winterfell’s steward and Sansa’s dearest friend. “He told her she
was very beautiful.”
“He’s going to marry her,” little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. “Then Sansa will be
queen of all the realm.”
Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya
thought with dull resentment. “Beth, you shouldn’t make up stories,” Sansa corrected
the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. She
looked at Arya. “What did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He’s very gallant, don’t you
think?”
“Jon says he looks like a girl,” Arya said.
Sansa sighed as she stitched. “Poor Jon,” she said. “He gets jealous because he’s a
bastard.”
“He’s our brother,” Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon
quiet of the tower room.
Septa Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin lipless mouth
made for frowning. It was frowning now. “What are you talking about, children?”
“Our half brother,” Sansa corrected, soft and precise. She smiled for the septa. “Arya and
I were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today,” she said.
Septa Mordane nodded. “Indeed. A great honor for us all.” Princess Myrcella smiled
uncertainly at the compliment. “Arya, why aren’t you at work?” the septa asked. She rose
to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. “Let me see your
stitches.”
Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa’s attention.
“Here,” she said, surrendering up her work.
The septa examined the fabric. “Arya, Arya, Arya,” she said. “This will not do. This will
not do at all.”
Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her
sister’s disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked
sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself out of her chair and
bolted for the door.
Septa Mordane called after her. “Arya, come back here! Don’t you take another step!
Your lady mother will hear of this. In front of our royal princess too! You’ll shame us all!”
Arya stopped at the door and turned back, biting her lip. The tears were running down
her cheeks now. She managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella. “By your leave, my lady.”
Myrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance. But if she was uncertain,
Septa Mordane was not. “Just where do you think you are going, Arya?” the septa
demanded.
Arya glared at her. “I have to go shoe a horse,” she said sweetly, taking a brief
satisfaction in the shock on the septa’s face. Then she whirled and made her exit,
running down the steps as fast as her feet would take her.
It wasn’t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya
had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and
dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and
the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother’s fine high
cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her
hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her
Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. It hurt that the one thing Arya
could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household.
Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped
for his sake that he had a good steward.
Nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to
her feet as soon as she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf pup loved her, even
if no one else did. They went everywhere together, and Nymeria slept in her room, at the
foot of her bed. If Mother had not forbidden it, Arya would gladly have taken the wolf
with her to needlework. Let Septa Mordane complain about her stitches then.
Nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her. She had yellow eyes. When they
caught the sunlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. Arya had named her after the
warrior queen of the Rhoyne, who had led her people across the narrow sea. That had
been a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had named her pup “Lady.” Arya made a face
and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, and she giggled.
By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to
her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion.
The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey
flat on his back. “Come,” she whispered to Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming
hard at her heels.
There was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the Great Keep
where you had a view of the whole yard. That was where they headed.
They arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up
languidly to his chin. He was watching the action, so absorbed that he seemed unaware
of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them. Nymeria stalked closer on
wary feet. Ghost, already larger than his litter mates, smelled her, gave her ear a careful
nip, and settled back down.
Jon gave her a curious look. “Shouldn’t you be working on your stitches, little sister?”
Arya made a face at him. “I wanted to see them fight.”
He smiled. “Come here, then.”
Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from
the yard below.
To her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling. Bran was so heavily padded he
looked as though he had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, who was plump to
begin with, seemed positively round. They were huffing and puffing and hitting at each
other with padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel, the
master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with magnificent white cheek whiskers. A
dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement, Robb’s voice the
loudest among them. She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside him, his black doublet
emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House, a look of wry contempt on his face.
Both of the combatants were staggering. Arya judged that they had been at it awhile.
“A shade more exhausting than needlework,” Jon observed.
“A shade more fun than needlework,” Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over,
and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father’s
face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little
Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had
been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It been Jon she
had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.
“Why aren’t you down in the yard?” Arya asked him.
He gave her a half smile. “Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,” he said.
“Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.”
“Oh.” Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya
reflected that life was not fair.
She watched her little brother whack at Tommen. “I could do just as good as Bran,” she
said. “He’s only seven. I’m nine.”
Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. “You’re too skinny,” he said.
He took her arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. “I doubt you
could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one.”
Arya snatched back her arm and glared at him. Jon messed up her hair again. They
watched Bran and Tommen circle each other.
“You see Prince Joffrey?” Jon asked.
She hadn’t, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back,
under the shade of the high stone wall. He was surrounded by men she did not
recognize, young squires in the livery of Lannister and Baratheon, strangers all. There
were a few older men among them; knights, she surmised.
“Look at the arms on his surcoat,” Jon suggested.
Arya looked. An ornate shield had been embroidered on the prince’s padded surcoat. No
doubt the needlework was exquisite. The arms were divided down the middle; on one
side was the crowned stag of the royal House, on the other the lion of Lannister.
“The Lannisters are proud,” Jon observed. “You’d think the royal sigil would be
sufficient, but no. He makes his mother’s House equal in honor to the king’s.”
“The woman is important too!” Arya protested.
Jon chuckled. “Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in
your arms.”
“A wolf with a fish in its mouth?” It made her laugh. “That would look silly. Besides, if a
girl can’t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?”
Jon shrugged. “Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not
the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.”
There was a shout from the courtyard below. Prince Tommen was rolling in the dust,
trying to get up and failing. All the padding made him look like a turtle on its back. Bran
was standing over him with upraised wooden sword, ready to whack him again once he
regained his feet. The men began to laugh.
“Enough!” Ser Rodrik called out. He gave the prince a hand and yanked him back to his
feet. “Well fought. Lew, Donnis, help them out of their armor.” He looked around.
“Prince Joffrey, Robb, will you go another round?”
Robb, already sweaty from a previous bout, moved forward eagerly. “Gladly.”
Joffrey moved into the sunlight in response to Rodrik’s summons. His hair shone like
spun gold. He looked bored. “This is a game for children, Ser Rodrik.”
Theon Greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter. “You are children,” he said derisively.
“Robb may be a child,” Joffrey said. “I am a prince. And I grow tired of swatting at
Starks with a play sword.”
“You got more swats than you gave, Joff,” Robb said. “Are you afraid?”
Prince Joffrey looked at him. “Oh, terrified,” he said. “You’re so much older.” Some of
the Lannister men laughed.
Jon looked down on the scene with a frown. “Joffrey is truly a little shit,” he told Arya.
Ser Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers. “What are you suggesting?” he
asked the prince.
“Live steel.”
“Done,” Robb shot back. “You’ll be sorry!”
The master-at-arms put a hand on Robb’s shoulder to quiet him. “Live steel is too
dangerous. I will permit you tourney swords, with blunted edges.”
Joffrey said nothing, but a man strange to Arya, a tall knight with black hair and burn
scars on his face, pushed forward in front of the prince. “This is your prince. Who are
you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword, ser?”
“Master-at-arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do well not to forget it.”
“Are you training women here?” the burned man wanted to know. He was muscled like a
bull.
“I am training knights,” Ser Rodrik said pointedly. “They will have steel when they are
ready. When they are of an age.”
The burned man looked at Robb. “How old are you, boy?”
“Fourteen,” Robb said.
“I killed a man at twelve. You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword.”
Arya could see Robb bristle. His pride was wounded. He turned on Ser Rodrik. “Let me
do it. I can beat him.”
“Beat him with a tourney blade, then,” Ser Rodrik said.
Joffrey shrugged. “Come and see me when you’re older, Stark. If you’re not too old.”
There was laughter from the Lannister men.
Robb’s curses rang through the yard. Arya covered her mouth in shock. Theon Greyjoy
seized Robb’s arm to keep him away from the prince. Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers
in dismay.
Joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother. “Come, Tommen,” he said.
“The hour of play is done. Leave the children to their frolics.”
That brought more laughter from the Lannisters, more curses from Robb. Ser Rodrik’s
face was beet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers. Theon kept Robb locked in
an iron grip until the princes and their party were safely away.
Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at
the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. “The show is done,”
he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed
against him. “You had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely
be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You’ll be sewing all through
winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked
tight between your frozen fingers.”
Arya didn’t think it was funny. “I hate needlework!” she said with passion. “It’s not fair!”
“Nothing is fair,” Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her,
Ghost moving silently beside him. Nymeria started to follow too, then stopped and came
back when she saw that Arya was not coming.
Reluctantly she turned in the other direction.
It was worse than Jon had thought. It wasn’t Septa Mordane waiting in her room. It was
Septa Mordane and her mother.

BRAN
The hunt left at dawn. The king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight. Prince Joffrey
rode with his father, so Robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well. Uncle Benjen,
Jory, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, and even the queen’s funny little brother had all ridden
out with them. It was the last hunt, after all. On the morrow they left for the south.
Bran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon. But Rickon was only a
baby and the girls were only girls and Jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found. Bran
did not look for him very hard. He thought Jon was angry at him. Jon seemed to be
angry at everyone these days. Bran did not know why. He was going with Uncle Ben to
the Wall, to join the Night’s Watch. That was almost as good as going south with the
king. Robb was the one they were leaving behind, not Jon.
For days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to ride the kingsroad on a
horse of his own, not a pony but a real horse. His father would be the Hand of the King,
and they were going to live in the red castle at King’s Landing, the castle the Dragonlords
had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, and dungeons where terrible things had
been done, and dragon heads on the walls. It gave Bran a shiver just to think of it, but he
was not afraid. How could he be afraid? His father would be with him, and the king with
all his knights and sworn swords.
Bran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old Nan said
they were the finest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of them, and they
wore white armor and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran
knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield.
Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins Ser Erryk and Ser
Arryk, who had died on one another’s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother
fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull,
Gerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold.
Two of the Kingsguard had come north with King Robert. Bran had watched them with
fascination, never quite daring to speak to them. Ser Boros was a bald man with a jowly
face, and Ser Meryn had droopy eyes and a beard the color of rust. Ser Jaime Lannister
looked more like the knights in the stories, and he was of the Kingsguard too, but Robb
said he had killed the old mad king and shouldn’t count anymore. The greatest living
knight was Ser Barristan Selmy, Barristan the Bold, the Lord Commander of the
Kingsguard. Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they reached
King’s Landing, and Bran had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see
a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine.
Yet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly Bran felt lost. Winterfell had been the
only home he had ever known. His father had told him that he ought to say his farewells
today, and he had tried. After the hunt had ridden out, he wandered through the castle
with his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones who would be left behind, Old Nan
and Gage the cook, Mikken in his smithy, Hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and
took care of his pony and never said anything but “Hodor,” the man in the glass gardens
who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit . . .
But it was no good. He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall,
except it wasn’t his pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony
behind, and all of a sudden Bran just wanted to sit down and cry. He turned and ran off
before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his eyes. That was the end
of his farewells. Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the godswood, trying to teach
his wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was smarter than any of the hounds in
his father’s kennel and Bran would have sworn he understood every word that was said
to him, but he showed very little interest in chasing sticks.
He was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran
so fast. Sansa had named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in
the songs, and little Rickon called his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty
stupid name for a direwolf. Jon’s wolf, the white one, was Ghost. Bran wished he had
thought of that first, even though his wolf wasn’t white. He had tried a hundred names
in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right.
Finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadn’t been up to
the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his
last chance.
He raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the
heart tree grew. The heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes,
Bran thought, or leaves that looked like hands. His wolf came sprinting at his heels. “You
stay here,” he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall. “Lie down.
That’s right. Now stay—”
The wolf did as he was told. Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away,
jumped, grabbed a low branch, and pulled himself up. He was halfway up the tree,
moving easily from limb to limb, when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl.
Bran looked back down. His wolf fell silent, staring up at him through slitted yellow
eyes. A strange chill went through him. He began to climb again. Once more the wolf
howled. “Quiet,” he yelled. “Sit down. Stay. You’re worse than Mother.” The howling
chased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and
out of sight.
The rooftops of Winterfell were Bran’s second home. His mother often said that Bran
could climb before he could walk. Bran could not remember when he first learned to
walk, but he could not remember when he started to climb either, so he supposed it must
be true.
To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and
tunnels spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted
up and down so that you couldn’t even be sure what floor you were on. The place had
grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree, Maester Luwin told him once,
and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth.
When he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see all of
Winterfell in a glance. He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds
wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below. Bran could perch for
hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep,
watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their
vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the
silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him feel
like he was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.
It taught him Winterfell’s secrets too. The builders had not even leveled the earth; there
were hills and valleys behind the walls of Winterfell. There was a covered bridge that
went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery.
Bran knew about that. And he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate,
climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the
stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of wall
looming over you. Even Maester Luwin didn’t know that, Bran was convinced.
His mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill himself. He told
her that he wouldn’t, but she never believed him. Once she made him promise that he
would stay on the ground. He had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight,
miserable every day, until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when
his brothers were fast asleep.
He confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt. Lord Eddard ordered him to the
godswood to cleanse himself. Guards were posted to see that Bran remained there alone
all night to reflect on his disobedience. The next morning Bran was nowhere to be seen.
They finally found him fast asleep in the upper branches of the tallest sentinel in the
grove.
As angry as he was, his father could not help but laugh. “You’re not my son,” he told
Bran when they fetched him down, “you’re a squirrel. So be it. If you must climb, then
climb, but try not to let your mother see you.”
Bran did his best, although he did not think he ever really fooled her. Since his father
would not forbid it, she turned to others. Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy
who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows
came to peck out his eyes. Bran was not impressed. There were crows’ nests atop the
broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and sometimes he filled his pockets with
corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand. None of them
had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes.
Later, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in Bran’s clothes and
flung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran if
he fell. That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said, “I’m
not made of clay. And anyhow, I never fall.”
Then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs, and
try to haul him down. That was the best time of all. It was like playing a game with his
brothers, except that Bran always won. None of the guards could climb half so well as
Bran, not even Jory. Most of the time they never saw him anyway. People never looked
up. That was another thing he liked about climbing; it was almost like being invisible.
He liked how it felt too, pulling himself up a wall stone by stone, fingers and toes digging
hard into the small crevices between. He always took off his boots and went barefoot
when he climbed; it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of two. He liked the
deep, sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward. He liked the way the air tasted way up
high, sweet and cold as a winter peach. He liked the birds: the crows in the broken
tower, the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones, the ancient owl
that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory. Bran knew them all.
Most of all, he liked going places that no one else could go, and seeing the grey sprawl of
Winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it. It made the whole castle Bran’s secret
place.
His favorite haunt was the broken tower. Once it had been a watchtower, the tallest in
Winterfell. A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, a
lightning strike had set it afire. The top third of the structure had collapsed inward, and
the tower had never been rebuilt. Sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the
tower, to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen stones and
charred and rotten beams. But no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now
except for Bran and the crows.
He knew two ways to get there. You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself,
but the stones were loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and Bran
never liked to put his full weight on them.
The best way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and cross over
the armory and the guards hall, leaping roof to roof, barefoot so the guards wouldn’t
hear you overhead. That brought you up to the blind side of the First Keep, the oldest
part of the castle, a squat round fortress that was taller than it looked. Only rats and
spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing. You could go
straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space, and swing from
gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side. From there, if you really
stretched, you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned
close. The last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie, no more than
ten feet, and then the crows would come round to see if you’d brought any corn.
Bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard
the voices. He was so startled he almost lost his grip. The First Keep had been empty all
his life.
“I do not like it,” a woman was saying. There was a row of windows beneath him, and the
voice was drifting out of the last window on this side. “You should be the Hand.”
“Gods forbid,” a man’s voice replied lazily. “It’s not an honor I’d want. There’s far too
much work involved.”
Bran hung, listening, suddenly afraid to go on. They might glimpse his feet if he tried to
swing by.
“Don’t you see the danger this puts us in?” the woman said. “Robert loves the man like a
brother.”
“Robert can barely stomach his brothers. Not that I blame him. Stannis would be enough
to give anyone indigestion.”
“Don’t play the fool. Stannis and Renly are one thing, and Eddard Stark is quite another.
Robert will listen to Stark. Damn them both. I should have insisted that he name you,
but I was certain Stark would refuse him.”
“We ought to count ourselves fortunate,” the man said. “The king might as easily have
named one of his brothers, or even Littlefinger, gods help us. Give me honorable
enemies rather than ambitious ones, and I’ll sleep more easily by night.”
They were talking about Father, Bran realized. He wanted to hear more. A few more
feet . . . but they would see him if he swung out in front of the window.
“We will have to watch him carefully,” the woman said.
“I would sooner watch you,” the man said. He sounded bored. “Come back here.”
“Lord Eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the
Neck,” the woman said. “Never. I tell you, he means to move against us. Why else would
he leave the seat of his power?”
“A hundred reasons. Duty. Honor. He yearns to write his name large across the book of
history, to get away from his wife, or both. Perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in
his life.”
“His wife is Lady Arryn’s sister. It’s a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us with her
accusations.”
Bran looked down. There was a narrow ledge beneath the window, only a few inches
wide. He tried to lower himself toward it. Too far. He would never reach.
“You fret too much. Lysa Arryn is a frightened cow.”
“That frightened cow shared Jon Arryn’s bed.”
“If she knew anything, she would have gone to Robert before she fled King’s Landing.”
“When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly Rock? I
think not. She knew the boy’s life would be hostage to her silence. She may grow bolder
now that he’s safe atop the Eyrie.”
“Mothers.” The man made the word sound like a curse. “I think birthing does something
to your minds. You are all mad.” He laughed. It was a bitter sound. “Let Lady Arryn grow
as bold as she likes. Whatever she knows, whatever she thinks she knows, she has no
proof.” He paused a moment. “Or does she?”
“Do you think the king will require proof?” the woman said. “I tell you, he loves me not.”
“And whose fault is that, sweet sister?”
Bran studied the ledge. He could drop down. It was too narrow to land on, but if he
could catch hold as he fell past, pull himself up . . . except that might make a noise, draw
them to the window. He was not sure what he was hearing, but he knew it was not meant
for his ears.
“You are as blind as Robert,” the woman was saying.
“If you mean I see the same thing, yes,” the man said. “I see a man who would sooner die
than betray his king.”
“He betrayed one already, or have you forgotten?” the woman said. “Oh, I don’t deny
he’s loyal to Robert, that’s obvious. What happens when Robert dies and Joff takes the
throne? And the sooner that comes to pass, the safer we’ll all be. My husband grows
more restless every day. Having Stark beside him will only make him worse. He’s still in
love with the sister, the insipid little dead sixteen-year-old. How long till he decides to
put me aside for some new Lyanna?”
Bran was suddenly very frightened. He wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he
had come, to find his brothers. Only what would he tell them? He had to get closer, Bran
realized. He had to see who was talking.
The man sighed. “You should think less about the future and more about the pleasures
at hand.”
“Stop that!” the woman said. Bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh, then the
man’s laughter.
Bran pulled himself up, climbed over the gargoyle, crawled out onto the roof. This was
the easy way. He moved across the roof to the next gargoyle, right above the window of
the room where they were talking.
“All this talk is getting very tiresome, sister,” the man said. “Come here and be quiet.”
Bran sat astride the gargoyle, tightened his legs around it, and swung himself around,
upside down. He hung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the
window. The world looked strange upside down. A courtyard swam dizzily below him, its
stones still wet with melted snow.
Bran looked in the window.
Inside the room, a man and a woman were wrestling. They were both naked. Bran could
not tell who they were. The man’s back was to him, and his body screened the woman
from view as he pushed her up against a wall.
There were soft, wet sounds. Bran realized they were kissing. He watched, wide-eyed
and frightened, his breath tight in his throat. The man had a hand down between her
legs, and he must have been hurting her there, because the woman started to moan, low
in her throat. “Stop it,” she said, “stop it, stop it. Oh, please . . . ” But her voice was low
and weak, and she did not push him away. Her hands buried themselves in his hair, his
tangled golden hair, and pulled his face down to her breast.
Bran saw her face. Her eyes were closed and her mouth was open, moaning. Her golden
hair swung from side to side as her head moved back and forth, but still he recognized
the queen.
He must have made a noise. Suddenly her eyes opened, and she was staring right at him.
She screamed.
Everything happened at once then. ‘ The woman pushed the man away wildly, shouting
and pointing. Bran tried to pull himself up, bending double as he reached for the
gargoyle. He was in too much of a hurry. His hand scraped uselessly across smooth
stone, and in his panic his legs slipped, and suddenly he was failing. There was an
instant of vertigo, a sickening lurch as the window flashed past. He shot out a hand,
grabbed for the ledge, lost it, caught it again with his other hand. He swung against the
building, hard. The impact took the breath out of him. Bran dangled, one-handed,
panting.
Faces appeared in the window above him.
The queen. And now Bran recognized the man beside her. They looked as much alike as
reflections in a mirror.
“He saw us,” the woman said shrilly.
“So he did,” the man said.
Bran’s fingers started to slip. He grabbed the ledge with his other hand. Fingernails dug
into unyielding stone. The man reached down. “Take my hand,” he said. “Before you fall.”
Bran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength. The man yanked him up to
the ledge. “What are you doing?” the woman demanded.
The man ignored her. He was very strong. He stood Bran up on the sill. “How old are
you, boy?”
“Seven,” Bran said, shaking with relief. His fingers had dug deep gouges in the man’s
forearm. He let go sheepishly.
The man looked over at the woman. “The things I do for love,” he said with loathing. He
gave Bran a shove.
Screaming, Bran went backward out the window into empty air. There was nothing to
grab on to. The courtyard rushed up to meet him.
Somewhere off in the distance, a wolf was howling. Crows circled the broken tower,
waiting for corn.

TYRION
Somewhere in the great stone maze of Winterfell, a wolf howled. The sound hung over
the castle like a flag of mourning.
Tyrion Lannister looked up from his books and shivered, though the library was snug
and warm. Something about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and
now and left him in a dark forest of the mind, running naked before the pack.
When the direwolf howled again, Tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book
he was reading, a hundred-year-old discourse on the changing of the seasons by a long-
dead maester. He covered a yawn with the back of his hand. His reading lamp was
flickering, its oil all but gone, as dawn light leaked through the high windows. He had
been at it all night, but that was nothing new. Tyrion Lannister was not much a one for
sleeping.
His legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench. He massaged some life back
into them and limped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly, his head
pillowed on an open book in front of him. Tyrion glanced at the title. A life of the Grand
Maester Aethelmure, no wonder. “Chayle,” he said softly. The young man jerked up,
blinking, confused, the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its silver chain. “I’m off to
break my fast. See that you return the books to the shelves. Be gentle with the Valyrian
scrolls, the parchment is very dry. Ayrmidon’s Engines of War is quite rare, and yours is
the only complete copy I’ve ever seen.” Chayle gaped at him, still half-asleep. Patiently,
Tyrion repeated his instructions, then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to
his tasks.
Outside, Tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious
descent of the steep stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library
tower. It was slow going; the steps were cut high and narrow, while his legs were short
and twisted. The rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of Winterfell, but the men were
already hard at it in the yard below. Sandor Clegane’s rasping voice drifted up to him.
“The boy is a long time dying. I wish he would be quicker about it.”
Tyrion glanced down and saw the Hound standing with young Joffrey as squires
swarmed around them. “At least he dies quietly,” the prince replied. “It’s the wolf that
makes the noise. I could scarce sleep last night.”
Clegane cast a long shadow across the hard-packed earth as his squire lowered the black
helm over his head. “I could silence the creature, if it please you,” he said through his
open visor. His boy placed a longsword in his hand. He tested the weight of it, slicing at
the cold morning air. Behind him, the yard rang to the clangor of steel on steel.
The notion seemed to delight the prince. “Send a dog to kill a dog!” he exclaimed.
“Winterfell is so infested with wolves, the Starks would never miss one.”
Tyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard. “I beg to differ, nephew,” he said. “The
Starks can count past six. Unlike some princes I might name.”
Joffrey had the grace at least to blush.
“A voice from nowhere,” Sandor said. He peered through his helm, looking this way and
that. “Spirits of the air!”
The prince laughed, as he always laughed when his bodyguard did this mummer’s farce.
Tyrion was used to it. “Down here.”
The tall man peered down at the ground, and pretended to notice him. “The little lord
Tyrion,” he said. “My pardons. I did not see you standing there.”
“I am in no mood for your insolence today.” Tyrion turned to his nephew. “Joffrey, it is
past time you called on Lord Eddard and his lady, to offer them your comfort.”
Joffrey looked as petulant as only a boy prince can look. “What good will my comfort do
them?”
“None,” Tyrion said. “Yet it is expected of you. Your absence has been noted.”
“The Stark boy is nothing to me,” Joffrey said. “I cannot abide the wailing of women.”
Tyrion Lannister reached up and slapped his nephew hard across the face. The boy’s
cheek began to redden.
“One word,” Tyrion said, “and I will hit you again.”
“I’m going to tell Mother!” Joffrey exclaimed.
Tyrion hit him again. Now both cheeks flamed.
“You tell your mother,” Tyrion told him. “But first you get yourself to Lord and Lady
Stark, and you fall to your knees in front of them, and you tell them how very sorry you
are, and that you are at their service if there is the slightest thing you can do for them or
theirs in this desperate hour, and that all your prayers go with them. Do you
understand? Do you?”
The boy looked as though he was going to cry. Instead, he managed a weak nod. Then he
turned and fled headlong from the yard, holding his cheek. Tyrion watched him run.
A shadow fell across his face. He turned to find Clegane looming overhead like a cliff.
His soot-dark armor seemed to blot out the sun. He had lowered the visor on his helm. It
was fashioned in the likeness of a snarling black hound, fearsome to behold, but Tyrion
had always thought it a great improvement over Clegane’s hideously burned face.
“The prince will remember that, little lord,” the Hound warned him. The helm turned his
laugh into a hollow rumble.
“I pray he does,” Tyrion Lannister replied. “If he forgets, be a good dog and remind
him.” He glanced around the courtyard. “Do you know where I might find my brother?”
“Breaking fast with the queen.”
“Ah,” Tyrion said. He gave Sandor Clegane a perfunctory nod and walked away as briskly
as his stunted legs would carry him, whistling. He pitied the first knight to try the Hound
today. The man did have a temper.
A cold, cheerless meal had been laid out in the morning room of the Guest House. Jaime
sat at table with Cersei and the children, talking in low, hushed voices.
“Is Robert still abed?” Tyrion asked as he seated himself, uninvited, at the table.
His sister peered at him with the same expression of faint distaste she had worn since
the day he was born. “The king has not slept at all,” she told him. “He is with Lord
Eddard. He has taken their sorrow deeply to heart.”
“He has a large heart, our Robert,” Jaime said with a lazy smile. There was very little
that Jaime took seriously. Tyrion knew that about his brother, and forgave it. During all
the terrible long years of his childhood, only Jaime had ever shown him the smallest
measure of affection or respect, and for that Tyrion was willing to forgive him most
anything.
A servant approached. “Bread,” Tyrion told him, “and two of those little fish, and a mug
of that good dark beer to wash them down. Oh, and some bacon. Burn it until it turns
black.” The man bowed and moved off. Tyrion turned back to his siblings. Twins, male
and female. They looked very much the part this morning. Both had chosen a deep green
that matched their eyes. Their blond curls were all a fashionable tumble, and gold
ornaments shone at wrists and fingers and throats.
Tyrion wondered what it would be like to have a twin, and decided that he would rather
not know. Bad enough to face himself in a looking glass every day. Another him was a
thought too dreadful to contemplate.
Prince Tommen spoke up. “Do you have news of Bran, Uncle?”
“I stopped by the sickroom last night,” Tyrion announced. “There was no change. The
maester thought that a hopeful sign.”
“I don’t want Brandon to die,” Tommen said timorously. He was a sweet boy. Not like
his brother, but then Jaime and Tyrion were somewhat less than peas in a pod
themselves.
“Lord Eddard had a brother named Brandon as well,” Jaime mused. “One of the
hostages murdered by Targaryen. It seems to be an unlucky name.”
“Oh, not so unlucky as all that, surely,” Tyrion said. The servant brought his plate. He
ripped off a chunk of black bread.
Cersei was studying him warily. “What do you mean?”
Tyrion gave her a crooked smile. “Why, only that Tommen may get his wish. The
maester thinks the boy may yet live.” He took a sip of beer.
Myrcella gave a happy gasp, and Tommen smiled nervously, but it was not the children
Tyrion was watching. The glance that passed between Jaime and Cersei lasted no more
than a second, but he did not miss it. Then his sister dropped her gaze to the table. “That
is no mercy. These northern gods are cruel to let the child linger in such pain.”
“What were the maester’s words?” Jaime asked.
The bacon crunched when he bit into it. Tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and
said, “He thinks that if the boy were going to die, he would have done so already. It has
been four days with no change.”
“Will Bran get better, Uncle?” little Myrcella asked. She had all of her mother’s beauty,
and none of her nature.
“His back is broken, little one,” Tyrion told her. “The fall shattered his legs as well. They
keep him alive with honey and water, or he would starve to death. Perhaps, if he wakes,
he will be able to eat real food, but he will never walk again.”
“If he wakes,” Cersei repeated. “Is that likely?”
“The gods alone know,” Tyrion told her. “The maester only hopes.” He chewed some
more bread. “I would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive. The creature is
outside his window day and night, howling. Every time they chase it away, it returns.
The maester said they closed the window once, to shut out the noise, and Bran seemed
to weaken. When they opened it again, his heart beat stronger.”
The queen shuddered. “There is something unnatural about those animals,” she said.
“They are dangerous. I will not have any of them coming south with us.”
Jaime said, “You’ll have a hard time stopping them, sister. They follow those girls
everywhere.”
Tyrion started on his fish. “Are you leaving soon, then?”
“Not near soon enough,” Cersei said. Then she frowned. “Are we leaving?” she echoed.
“What about you? Gods, don’t tell me you are staying here?”
Tyrion shrugged. “Benjen Stark is returning to the Night’s Watch with his brother’s
bastard. I have a mind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard so much of.”
Jaime smiled. “I hope you’re not thinking of taking the black on us, sweet brother.”
Tyrion laughed. “What, me, celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to
Casterly Rock. No, I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the
world.”
Cersei stood abruptly. “The children don’t need to hear this filth. Tommen, Myrcella,
come.” She strode briskly from the morning room, her train and her pups trailing behind
her.
Jaime Lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes. “Stark will
never consent to leave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death.”
“He will if Robert commands it,” Tyrion said. “And Robert will command it. There is
nothing Lord Eddard can do for the boy in any case.”
“He could end his torment,” Jaime said. “I would, if it were my son. It would be a mercy.”
“I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard, sweet brother,” Tyrion said.
“He would not take it kindly.”
“Even if the boy does live, he will be a cripple. Worse than a cripple. A grotesque. Give
me a good clean death.”
Tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders. “Speaking for the
grotesques,” he said, “I beg to differ. Death is so terribly final, while life is full of
possibilities.”
Jaime smiled. “You are a perverse little imp, aren’t you?”
“Oh, yes,” Tyrion admitted. “I hope the boy does wake. I would be most interested to
hear what he might have to say.”
His brother’s smile curdled like sour milk. “Tyrion, my sweet brother,” he said darkly,
“there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on.”
Tyrion’s mouth was full of bread and fish. He took a swallow of strong black beer to
wash it all down, and grinned up wolfishly at Jaime, “Why, Jaime, my sweet brother,” he
said, “you wound me. You know how much I love my family.”

JON
Jon climbed the steps slowly, trying not to think that this might be the last time ever.
Ghost padded silently beside him. Outside, snow swirled through the castle gates, and
the yard was all noise and chaos, but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and
quiet. Too quiet for Jon’s liking.
He reached the landing and stood for a long moment, afraid. Ghost nuzzled at his hand.
He took courage from that. He straightened, and entered the room.
Lady Stark was there beside his bed. She had been there, day and night, for close on a
fortnight. Not for a moment had she left Bran’s side. She had her meals brought to her
there, and chamber pots as well, and a small hard bed to sleep on, though it was said she
had scarcely slept at all. She fed him herself, the honey and water and herb mixture that
sustained life. Not once did she leave the room. So Jon had stayed away.
But now there was no more time.
He stood in the door for a moment, afraid to speak, afraid to come closer. The window
was open. Below, a wolf howled. Ghost heard and lifted his head.
Lady Stark looked over. For a moment she did not seem to recognize him. Finally she
blinked. “What are you doing here?” she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless.
“I came to see Bran,” Jon said. “To say good-bye.”
Her face did not change. Her long auburn hair was dull and tangled. She looked as
though she had aged twenty years. “You’ve said it. Now go away.”
Part of him wanted only to flee, but he knew that if he did he might never see Bran again.
He took a nervous step into the room. “Please,” he said.
Something cold moved in her eyes. “I told you to leave,” she said. “We don’t want you
here.”
Once that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him cry. Now
it only made him angry. He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch soon, and
face worse dangers than Catelyn Tully Stark. “He’s my brother,” he said.
“Shall I call the guards?”
“Call them,” Jon said, defiant. “You can’t stop me from seeing him.” He crossed the
room, keeping the bed between them, and looked down on Bran where he lay.
She was holding one of his hands. It looked like a claw. This was not the Bran he
remembered. The flesh had all gone from him. His skin stretched tight over bones like
sticks. Under the blanket, his legs bent in ways that made Jon sick. His eyes were sunken
deep into black pits; open, but they saw nothing. The fall had shrunken him somehow.
He looked half a leaf, as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave.
Yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs, his chest rose and fell with each shallow
breath.
“Bran,” he said, “I’m sorry I didn’t come before. I was afraid.” He could feel the tears
rolling down his cheeks. Jon no longer cared. “Don’t die, Bran. Please. We’re all waiting
for you to wake up. Me and Robb and the girls, everyone . . . ”
Lady Stark was watching. She had not raised a cry. Jon took that for acceptance. Outside
the window, the direwolf howled again. The wolf that Bran had not had time to name.
“I have to go now,” Jon said. “Uncle Benjen is waiting. I’m to go north to the Wall. We
have to leave today, before the snows come.” He remembered how excited Bran had
been at the prospect of the journey. It was more than he could bear, the thought of
leaving him behind like this. Jon brushed away his tears, leaned over, and kissed his
brother lightly on the lips.
“I wanted him to stay here with me,” Lady Stark said softly.
Jon watched her, wary. She was not even looking at him. She was talking to him, but for
a part of her, it was as though he were not even in the room.
“I prayed for it,” she said dully. “He was my special boy. I went to the sept and prayed
seven times to the seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind and leave him
here with me. Sometimes prayers are answered.”
Jon did not know what to say. “It wasn’t your fault,” he managed after an awkward
silence.
Her eyes found him. They were full of poison. “I need none of your absolution, bastard.”
Jon lowered his eyes. She was cradling one of Bran’s hands. He took the other, squeezed
it. Fingers like the bones of birds. “Good-bye,” he said.
He was at the door when she called out to him. “Jon,” she said. He should have kept
going, but she had never called him by his name before. He turned to find her looking at
his face, as if she were seeing it for the first time.
“Yes?” he said.
“It should have been you,” she told him. Then she turned back to Bran and began to
weep, her whole body shaking with the sobs. Jon had never seen her cry before.
It was a long walk down to the yard.
Outside, everything was noise and confusion. Wagons were being loaded, men were
shouting, horses were being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables. A light
snow had begun to fall, and everyone was in an uproar to be off.
Robb was in the middle of it, shouting commands with the best of them. He seemed to
have grown of late, as if Bran’s fall and his mother’s collapse had somehow made him
stronger. Grey Wind was at his side.
“Uncle Benjen is looking for you,” he told Jon. “He wanted to be gone an hour ago.”
“I know,” Jon said. “Soon.” He looked around at all the noise and confusion. “Leaving is
harder than I thought.”
“For me too,” Robb said. He had snow in his hair, melting from the heat of his body.
“Did you see him?”
Jon nodded, not trusting himself to speak.
“He’s not going to die,” Robb said. “I know it.”
“You Starks are hard to kill,” Jon agreed. His voice was flat and tired. The visit had taken
all the strength from him.
Robb knew something was wrong. “My mother . . . ”
“She was . . . very kind,” Jon told him.
Robb looked relieved. “Good.” He smiled. “The next time I see you, you’ll be all in black.”
Jon forced himself to smile back. “It was always my color. How long do you think it will
be?”
“Soon enough,” Robb promised. He pulled Jon to him and embraced him fiercely.
“Farewell, Snow.”
Jon hugged him back. “And you, Stark. Take care of Bran.”
“I will.” They broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly. “Uncle Benjen said to
send you to the stables if I saw you,” Robb finally said.
“I have one more farewell to make,” Jon told him.
“Then I haven’t seen you,” Robb replied. Jon left him standing there in the snow,
surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses. It was a short walk to the armory. He
picked up his package and took the covered bridge across to the Keep.
Arya was in her room, packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she was.
Nymeria was helping. Arya would only have to point, and the wolf would bound across
the room, snatch up some wisp of silk in her jaws, and fetch it back. But when she
smelled Ghost, she sat down on her haunches and yelped at them.
Arya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet. She threw her skinny arms
tight around his neck. “I was afraid you were gone,” she said, her breath catching in her
throat. “They wouldn’t let me out to say good-bye.”
“What did you do now?” Jon was amused.
Arya disentangled herself from him and made a face. “Nothing. I was all packed and
everything.” She gestured at the huge chest, no more than a third full, and at the clothes
that were scattered all over the room. “Septa Mordane says I have to do it all over. My
things weren’t properly folded, she says. A proper southron lady doesn’t just throw her
clothes inside her chest like old rags, she says.”
“Is that what you did, little sister?”
“Well, they’re going to get all messed up anyway,” she said. “Who cares how they’re
folded?”
“Septa Mordane,” Jon told her. “I don’t think she’d like Nymeria helping, either.” The
she-wolf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes. “It’s just as well. I have
something for you to take with you, and it has to be packed very carefully.”
Her face lit up. “A present?”
“You could call it that. Close the door.”
Wary but excited, Arya checked the hall. “Nymeria, here. Guard.” She left the wolf out
there to warn of intruders and closed the door. By then Jon had pulled off the rags he’d
wrapped it in. He held it out to her.
Arya’s eyes went wide. Dark eyes, like his. “A sword,” she said in a small, hushed breath.
The scabbard was soft grey leather, supple as sin. Jon drew out the blade slowly, so she
could see the deep blue sheen of the steel. “This is no toy,” he told her. “Be careful you
don’t cut yourself. The edges are sharp enough to shave with.”
“Girls don’t shave,” Arya said.
“Maybe they should. Have you ever seen the septa’s legs?”
She giggled at him. “It’s so skinny.”
“So are you,” Jon told her. “I had Mikken make this special. The bravos use swords like
this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities. It won’t hack a man’s head off, but it
can poke him full of holes if you’re fast enough.”
“I can be fast,” Arya said.
“You’ll have to work at it every day.” He put the sword in her hands, showed her how to
hold it, and stepped back. “How does it feel? Do you like the balance?”
“I think so,” Arya said.
“First lesson,” Jon said. “Stick them with the pointy end.”
Arya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade. The blow stung, but Jon
found himself grinning like an idiot. “I know which end to use,” Arya said. A doubtful
look crossed her face. “Septa Mordane will take it away from me.”
“Not if she doesn’t know you have it,” Jon said.
“Who will I practice with?”
“You’ll find someone,” Jon promised her. “King’s Landing is a true city, a thousand times
the size of Winterfell. Until you find a partner, watch how they fight in the yard. Run,
and ride, make yourself strong. And whatever you do . . . ”
Arya knew what was coming next. They said it together.
“ . . . don’t . . . tell . . . Sansa!”
Jon messed up her hair. “I will miss you, little sister.”
Suddenly she looked like she was going to cry. “I wish you were coming with us.”
“Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle. Who knows?” He was feeling better
now. He was not going to let himself be sad. “I better go. I’ll spend my first year on the
Wall emptying chamber pots if I keep Uncle Ben waiting any longer.”
Arya ran to him for a last hug. “Put down the sword first,” Jon warned her, laughing. She
set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses.
When he turned back at the door, she was holding it again, trying it for balance. “I
almost forgot,” he told her. “All the best swords have names.”
“Like Ice,” she said. She looked at the blade in her hand. “Does this have a name? Oh,
tell me.”
“Can’t you guess?” Jon teased. “Your very favorite thing.”
Arya seemed puzzled at first. Then it came to her. She was that quick. They said it
together:
“Needle!”
The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north.

DAENERYS
Daenerys Targaryen wed Khal Drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond
the walls of Pentos, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man’s life
must be done beneath the open sky.
Drogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come, forty thousand
Dothraki warriors and uncounted numbers of women, children, and slaves. Outside the
city walls they camped with their vast herds, raising palaces of woven grass, eating
everything in sight, and making the good folk of Pentos more anxious with every passing
day.
“My fellow magisters have doubled the size of the city guard,” Illyrio told them over
platters of honey duck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been
Drogo’s. The khal had joined his khalasar, his estate given over to Daenerys and her
brother until the wedding.
“Best we get Princess Daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of
Pentos away to sellswords and bravos,” Ser Jorah Mormont jested. The exile had offered
her brother his sword the night Dany had been sold to Kbal Drogo; Viserys had accepted
eagerly. Mormont had been their constant companion ever since.
Magister Illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard, but Viserys did not so much as
smile. “He can have her tomorrow, if he likes,” her brother said. He glanced over at
Dany, and she lowered her eyes. “So long as he pays the price.”
Illyrio waved a languid hand in the air, rings glittering on his fat fingers. “I have told
you, all is settled. Trust me. The khal has promised you a crown, and you shall have it.”
“Yes, but when?”
“When the khal chooses,” Illyrio said. “He will have the girl first, and after they are wed
he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at
Vaes Dothrak. After that, perhaps. If the omens favor war.”
Viserys seethed with impatience. “I piss on Dothraki omens. The Usurper sits on my
father’s throne. How long must I wait?”
Illyrio gave a massive shrug. “You have waited most of your life, great king. What is
another few months, another few years?”
Ser Jorah, who had traveled as far east as Vaes Dothrak, nodded in agreement. “I
counsel you to be patient, Your Grace. The Dothraki are true to their word, but they do
things in their own time. A lesser man may beg a favor from the khal, but must never
presume to berate him.”
Viserys bristled. “Guard your tongue, Mormont, or I’ll have it out. I am no lesser man, I
am the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. The dragon does not beg.”
Ser Jorah lowered his eyes respectfully. Illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from
the duck. Honey and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as he
nibbled at the tender meat. There are no more dragons, Dany thought, staring at her
brother, though she did not dare say it aloud.
Yet that night she dreamt of one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was naked,
clumsy with fear. She ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. He struck
her again. She stumbled and fell. “You woke the dragon,” he screamed as he kicked her.
“You woke the dragon, you woke the dragon.” Her thighs were slick with blood. She
closed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a hideous ripping sound and
the crackling of some great fire. When she looked again, Viserys was gone, great columns
of flame rose all around, and in the midst of them was the dragon. It turned its great
head slowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered with a fine
sheen of sweat. She had never been so afraid . . .
. . . until the day of her wedding came at last.
The ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk, an endless day of drinking and
feasting and fighting. A mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces,
and there Dany was seated beside Khal Drogo, above the seething sea of Dothraki. She
had never seen so many people in one place, nor people so strange and frightening. The
horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the Free
Cities, but out under the open sky they kept the old ways. Men and women alike wore
painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze
medallion belts, and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering
pits. They gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers, drank
themselves blind on fermented mare’s milk and Illyrio’s fine wines, and spat jests at
each other across the fires, their voices harsh and alien in Dany’s ears.
Viserys was seated just below her, splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet
dragon on the chest. Illyrio and Ser Jorah sat beside him. Theirs was a place of high
honor, just below the khal’s own bloodriders, but Dany could see the anger in her
brother’s lilac eyes. He did not like sitting beneath her, and he fumed when the slaves
offered each dish first to the khal and his bride, and served him from the portions they
refused. He could do nothing but nurse his resentment, so nurse it he did, his mood
growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person.
Dany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde. Her
brother had told her to smile, and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came
unbidden to her eyes. She did her best to hide them, knowing how angry Viserys would
be if he saw her crying, terrified of how Khal Drogo might react. Food was brought to
her, steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and Dothraki blood pies, and later
fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of Pentos, but she
waved it all away. Her stomach was a roil, and she knew she could keep none of it down.
There was no one to talk to. Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to his
bloodriders, and laughed at their replies, but he scarcely glanced at Dany beside him.
They had no common language. Dothraki was incomprehensible to her, and the khal
knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities, and none at all of the
Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She would even have welcomed the
conversation of Illyrio and her brother, but they were too far below to hear her.
So she sat in her wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, talking
silently to herself. I am blood of the dragon, she told herself. I am Daenerys Stormborn,
Princess of Dragonstone, of the blood and seed of Aegon the Conqueror.
The sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her first man die. Drums
were beating as some of the women danced for the khal. Drogo watched without
expression, but his eyes followed their movements, and from time to time he would toss
down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over.
The warriors were watching too. One of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a
dancer by the arm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right there, as a
stallion mounts a mare. Illyrio had told her that might happen. “The Dothraki mate like
the animals in their herds. There is no privacy in a khalasar, and they do not understand
sin or shame as we do.”
Dany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized what was happening,
but a second warrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no way to avert
her eyes. Then two men seized the same woman. She heard a shout, saw a shove, and in
the blink of an eye the arakhs were out, long razor-sharp blades, half sword and half
scythe. A dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed, leaping toward each
other, whirling the blades around their heads, shrieking insults at each clash. No one
made a move to interfere.
It ended as quickly as it began. The arakhs shivered together faster than Dany could
follow, one man missed a step, the other swung his blade in a flat arc. Steel bit into flesh
just above the Dothraki’s waist, and opened him from backbone to belly button, spilling
his entrails into the dust. As the loser died, the winner took hold of the nearest woman—
not even the one they had been quarreling over—and had her there and then. Slaves
carried off the body, and the dancing resumed.
Magister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too. “A Dothraki wedding without at least
three deaths is deemed a dull affair,” he had said. Her wedding must have been
especially blessed; before the day was over, a dozen men had died.
As the hours passed, the terror grew in Dany, until it was all she could do not to scream.
She was afraid of the Dothraki, whose ways seemed alien and monstrous, as if they were
beasts in human skins and not true men at all. She was afraid of her brother, of what he
might do if she failed him. Most of all, she was afraid of what would happen tonight
under the stars, when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant who sat drinking
beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask.
I am the blood of the dragon, she told herself again.
When at last the sun was low in the sky, Khal Drogo clapped his hands together, and the
drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt. Drogo stood and pulled
Dany to her feet beside him. It was time for her bride gifts.
And after the gifts, she knew, after the sun had gone down, it would be time for the first
ride and the consummation of her marriage. Dany tried to put the thought aside, but it
would not leave her. She hugged herself to try to keep from shaking.
Her brother Viserys gifted her with three handmaids. Dany knew they had cost him
nothing; Illyrio no doubt had provided the girls. Irri and Jhiqui were copper-skinned
Dothraki with black hair and almond-shaped eyes, Doreah a fair-haired, blue-eyed
Lysene girl. “These are no common servants, sweet sister,” her brother told her as they
were brought forward one by one. “Illyrio and I selected them personally for you. Irri
will teach you riding, Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue, and Doreah will instruct you in the
womanly arts of love.” He smiled thinly. “She’s very good, Illyrio and I can both swear to
that.”
Ser Jorah Mormont apologized for his gift. “It is a small thing, my princess, but all a
poor exile could afford,” he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her. They
were histories and songs of the Seven Kingdoms, she saw, written in the Common
Tongue. She thanked him with all her heart.
Magister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing
between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze. When she opened it, she found piles
of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce . . . and resting on top,
nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful
things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors
that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her
hands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine
porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as
if it were all of solid stone. The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as
she turned the egg between her fingers, they shimmered like polished metal in the light
of the setting sun. One egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came
and went depending on how Dany turned it. Another was pale cream streaked with gold.
The last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls.
“What are they?” she asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder.
“Dragon’s eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,” said Magister Illyrio. “The eons
have turned them to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty.”
“I shall treasure them always.” Dany had heard tales of such eggs, but she had never
seen one, nor thought to see one. It was a truly magnificent gift, though she knew that
Illyrio could afford to be lavish. He had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his
part in selling her to Khal Drogo.
The khal’s bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons, and splendid weapons
they were. Haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle, Cohollo a
magnificent arakh chased in gold, and Qotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller
than she was. Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah had taught her the traditional refusals for
these offerings. “This is a gift worthy of a great warrior, O blood of my blood, and I am
but a woman. Let my lord husband bear these in my stead.” And so Khal Drogo too
received his “bride gifts.”
Other gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki: slippers and jewels and silver
rings for her hair, medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs, sandsilks and jars of
scent, needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass, and a gown made from the
skin of a thousand mice. “A handsome gift, Khaleesi,” Magister Illyrio said of the last,
after he had told her what it was. “Most lucky.” The gifts mounted up around her in great
piles, more gifts than she could possibly imagine, more gifts than she could want or use.
And last of all, Khal Drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her. An expectant hush
rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side, growing until it had
swallowed the whole khalasar. When he returned, the dense press of Dothraki gift-
givers parted before him, and he led the horse to her.
She was a young filly, spirited and splendid. Dany knew just enough about horses to
know that this was no ordinary animal. There was something about her that took the
breath away. She was grey as the winter sea, with a mane like silver smoke.
Hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse’s neck, ran her fingers through the
silver of her mane. Khal Drogo said something in Dothraki and Magister Illyrio
translated. “Silver for the silver of your hair, the khal says.”
“She’s beautiful,” Dany murmured.
“She is the pride of the khalasar, “ Illyrio said. “Custom decrees that the khaleesi must
ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal.”
Drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist. He lifted her up as easily as if she
were a child and set her on the thin Dothraki saddle, so much smaller than the ones she
was used to. Dany sat there uncertain for a moment. No one had told her about this part.
“What should I do?” she asked Illyrio.
It was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered. “Take the reins and ride. You need not go far.”
Nervously Dany gathered the reins in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups.
She was only a fair rider; she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and
palanquin than by horseback. Praying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself,
she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees.
And for the first time in hours, she forgot to be afraid. Or perhaps it was for the first time
ever.
The silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait, and the crowd parted for her,
every eye upon them. Dany found herself moving faster than she had intended, yet
somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying. The horse broke into a trot, and she
smiled. Dothraki scrambled to clear a path. The slightest pressure with her legs, the
lightest touch on the reins, and the filly responded. She sent it into a gallop, and now the
Dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way.
As she turned to ride back, a firepit loomed ahead, directly in her path. They were
hemmed in on either side, with no room to stop. A daring she had never known filled
Daenerys then, and she gave the filly her head.
The silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings.
When she pulled up before Magister Illyrio, she said, “Tell Khal Drogo that he has given
me the wind.” The fat Pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in
Dothraki, and Dany saw her new husband smile for the first time.
The last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of Pentos to the west just then.
Dany had lost all track of time. Khal Drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth
his own horse, a lean red stallion. As the khal was saddling the horse, Viserys slid close
to Dany on her silver, dug his fingers into her leg, and said, “Please him, sweet sister, or I
swear, you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before.”
The fear came back to her then, with her brother’s words. She felt like a child once more,
only thirteen and all alone, not ready for what was about to happen to her.
They rode out together as the stars came out, leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces
behind. Khal Drogo spoke no word to her, but drove his stallion at a hard trot through
the gathering dusk. The tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode. “I am the
blood of the dragon,” she whispered aloud as she followed, trying to keep her courage
up. “I am the blood of the dragon. I am the blood of the dragon.” The dragon was never
afraid.
Afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden, but it was full dark
when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream. Drogo swung off his horse
and lifted her down from hers. She felt as fragile as glass in his hands, her limbs as weak
as water. She stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured
the horses, and when he turned to look at her, she began to cry.
Khal Drogo stared at her tears, his face strangely empty of expression. “No,” he said. He
lifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb.
“You speak the Common Tongue,” Dany said in wonder.
“No,” he said again.
Perhaps he had only that word, she thought, but it was one word more than she had
known he had, and somehow it made her feel a little better. Drogo touched her hair
lightly, sliding the silver-blond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in
Dothraki. Dany did not understand the words, yet there was warmth in the tone, a
tenderness she had never expected from this man.
He put his finger under her chin and lifted her head, so she was looking up into his eyes.
Drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone. Taking her lightly under the arms,
he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream. Then he sat on the
ground facing her, legs crossed beneath him, their faces finally at a height. “No,” he said.
“Is that the only word you know?” she asked him.
Drogo did not reply. His long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him. He pulled it
over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair, one by one. After a
moment Dany leaned forward to help. When they were done, Drogo gestured. She
understood. Slowly, carefully, she began to undo his braid.
It took a long time. All the while he sat there silently, watching her. When she was done,
he shook his head, and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness, oiled and
gleaming. She had never seen hair so long, so black, so thick.
Then it was his turn. He began to undress her.
His fingers were deft and strangely tender. He removed her silks one by one, carefully,
while Dany sat unmoving, silent, looking at his eyes. When he bared her small breasts,
she could not help herself. She averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands.
“No,” Drogo said. He pulled her hands away from her breasts, gently but firmly, then
lifted her face again to make her look at him. “No,” he repeated.
“No,” she echoed back at him.
He stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks. The night air
was chilly on her bare skin. She shivered, and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs. She
was afraid of what would come next, but for a while nothing happened. Khal Drogo sat
with his legs crossed, looking at her, drinking in her body with his eyes.
After a while he began to touch her. Lightly at first, then harder. She could sense the
fierce strength in his hands, but he never hurt her. He held her hand in his own and
brushed her fingers, one by one. He ran a hand gently down her leg. He stroked her face,
tracing the curve of her ears, running a finger gently around her mouth. He put both
hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers. He turned her around, massaged her
shoulders, slid a knuckle down the path of her spine.
It seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts. He stroked the
soft skin underneath until it tingled. He circled her nipples with his thumbs, pinched
them between thumb and forefinger, then began to pull at her, very lightly at first, then
more insistently, until her nipples stiffened and began to ache.
He stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her
heart fluttering in her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his
eyes. “No?” he said, and she knew it was a question.
She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs. “Yes,” she
whispered as she put his finger inside her.

EDDARD
The summons came in the hour before the dawn, when the world was still and grey.
Alyn shook him roughly from his dreams and Ned stumbled into the predawn chill,
groggy from sleep, to find his horse saddled and the king already mounted. Robert wore
thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered his ears, and looked
for all the world like a bear sitting a horse. “Up, Stark!” he roared. “Up, up! We have
matters of state to discuss.”
“By all means,” Ned said. “Come inside, Your Grace.” Alyn lifted the flap of the tent.
“No, no, no,” Robert said. His breath steamed with every word. “The camp is full of ears.
Besides, I want to ride out and taste this country of yours.” Ser Boros and Ser Meryn
waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen, Ned saw. There was nothing to do but rub
the sleep from his eyes, dress, and mount up.
Robert set the pace, driving his huge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along beside
him, trying to keep up. He called out a question as they rode, but the wind blew his
words away, and the king did not hear him. After that Ned rode in silence. They soon left
the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist. By then the guard had
fallen back a small distance, safely out of earshot, but still Robert would not slow.
Dawn broke as they crested a low ridge, and finally the king pulled up. By then they were
miles south of the main party. Robert was flushed and exhilarated as Ned reined up
beside him. “Gods,” he swore, laughing, “it feels good to get out and ride the way a man
was meant to ride! I swear, Ned, this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad.” He
had never been a patient man, Robert Baratheon. “That damnable wheelhouse, the way
it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain . . . I
promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, I’m going to burn it, and Cersei
can walk!”
Ned laughed. “I will gladly light the torch for you.”
“Good man!” The king clapped him on the shoulder. “I’ve half a mind to leave them all
behind and just keep going.”
A smile touched Ned’s lips. “I do believe you mean it.”
“I do, I do,” the king said. “What do you say, Ned? Just you and me, two vagabond
knights on the kingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us,
and maybe a farmer’s daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight.”
“Would that we could,” Ned said, “but we have duties now, my liege . . . to the realm, to
our children, I to my lady wife and you to your queen. We are not the boys we were.”
“You were never the boy you were,” Robert grumbled. “More’s the pity. And yet there
was that one time . . . what was her name, that common girl of yours? Becca? No, she
was one of mine, gods love her, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in
them. Yours was . . . Aleena? No. You told me once. Was it Merryl? You know the one I
mean, your bastard’s mother?”
“Her name was Wylla,” Ned replied with cool courtesy, “and I would sooner not speak of
her.”
“Wylla. Yes.” The king grinned. “She must have been a rare wench if she could make
Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor, even for an hour. You never told me what she
looked like . . . ”
Ned’s mouth tightened in anger. “Nor will I. Leave it be, Robert, for the love you say you
bear me. I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn, in the sight of gods and men.”
“Gods have mercy, you scarcely knew Catelyn.”
“I had taken her to wife. She was carrying my child.”
“You are too hard on yourself, Ned. You always were. Damn it, no woman wants Baelor
the Blessed in her bed.” He slapped a hand on his knee. “Well, I’ll not press you if you
feel so strong about it, though I swear, at times you’re so prickly you ought to take the
hedgehog as your sigil.”
The rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn. A wide plain
spread out beneath them, bare and brown, its flatness here and there relieved by long,
low hummocks. Ned pointed them out to his king. “The barrows of the First Men.”
Robert frowned. “Have we ridden onto a graveyard?”
“There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace,” Ned told him. “This land is
old.”
“And cold,” Robert grumbled, pulling his cloak more tightly around himself. The guard
had reined up well behind them, at the bottom of the ridge. “Well, I did not bring you
out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard. There was a rider in the night,
from Lord Varys in King’s Landing. Here.” The king pulled a paper from his belt and
handed it to Ned.
Varys the eunuch was the king’s master of whisperers. He served Robert now as he had
once served Aerys Targaryen. Ned unrolled the paper with trepidation, thinking of Lysa
and her terrible accusation, but the message did not concern Lady Arryn. “What is the
source for this information?”
“Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont?”
“Would that I might forget him,” Ned said bluntly. The Mormonts of Bear Island were an
old house, proud and honorable, but their lands were cold and distant and poor. Ser
Jorah had tried to swell the family coffers by selling some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver.
As the Mormonts were bannermen to the Starks, his crime had dishonored the north.
Ned had made the long journey west to Bear Island, only to find when he arrived that
Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the king’s justice. Five years had
passed since then.
“Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to
return from exile,” Robert explained. “Lord Varys makes good use of him.”
“So the slaver has become a spy,” Ned said with distaste. He handed the letter back. “I
would rather he become a corpse.”
“Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses,” Robert said. “Jorah aside, what
do you make of his report?”
“Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Shall we send her a
wedding gift?”
The king frowned. “A knife, perhaps. A good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.”
Ned did not feign surprise; Robert’s hatred of the Targaryens was a madness in him. He
remembered the angry words they had exchanged when Tywin Lannister had presented
Robert with the corpses of Rhaegar’s wife and children as a token of fealty. Ned had
named that murder; Robert called it war. When he had protested that the young prince
and princess were no more than babes, his new-made king had replied, “I see no babes.
Only dragonspawn.” Not even Jon Arryn had been able to calm that storm. Eddard Stark
had ridden out that very day in a cold rage, to fight the last battles of the war alone in the
south. It had taken another death to reconcile them; Lyanna’s death, and the grief they
had shared over her passing.
This time, Ned resolved to keep his temper. “Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a
child. You are no Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents.” It was said that Rhaegar’s
little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords. The boy
had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord Tywin’s soldiers had torn him from his
mother’s breast and dashed his head against a wall.
“And how long will this one remain an innocent?” Robert’s mouth grew hard. “This child
will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me.”
“Nonetheless,” Ned said, “the murder of children . . . it would be
vile . . . unspeakable . . . ”
“Unspeakable?” the king roared. “What Aerys did to your brother Brandon was
unspeakable. The way your lord father died, that was unspeakable. And Rhaegar . . . how
many times do you think he raped your sister? How many hundreds of times?” His voice
had grown so loud that his horse whinnied nervously beneath him. The king jerked the
reins hard, quieting the animal, and pointed an angry finger at Ned. “I will kill every
Targaryen I can get my hands on, until they are as dead as their dragons, and then I will
piss on their graves.”
Ned knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him. If the years had not
quenched Robert’s thirst for revenge, no words of his would help. “You can’t get your
hands on this one, can you?” he said quietly.
The king’s mouth twisted in a bitter grimace. “No, gods be cursed. Some pox-ridden
Pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy-
hatted eunuchs all around them, and now he’s handed them over to the Dothraki. I
should have had them both killed years ago, when it was easy to get at them, but Jon was
as bad as you. More fool I, I listened to him.”
“Jon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand.”
Robert snorted. The anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come. “This Khal Drogo
is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde. What would Jon say to that?”
“He would say that even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, so long as they
remain on the other side of the narrow sea,” Ned replied calmly. “The barbarians have
no ships. They hate and fear the open sea.”
The king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle. “Perhaps. There are ships to be had in the
Free Cities, though. I tell you, Ned, I do not like this marriage. There are still those in the
Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. Do you forget how many houses fought for
Targaryen in the war? They bide their time for now, but give them half a chance, they
will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me. If the beggar king crosses with a
Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him.”
“He will not cross,” Ned promised. “And if by some mischance he does, we will throw
him back into the sea. Once you choose a new Warden of the East—”
The king groaned. “For the last time, I will not name the Arryn boy Warden. I know the
boy is your nephew, but with Targaryens climbing in bed with Dothraki, I would be mad
to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child.”
Ned was ready for that. “Yet we still must have a Warden of the East. If Robert Arryn will
not do, name one of your brothers. Stannis proved himself at the siege of Storm’s End,
surely.”
He let the name hang there for a moment. The king frowned and said nothing. He
looked uncomfortable.
“That is,” Ned finished quietly, watching, “unless you have already promised the honor
to another.”
For a moment Robert had the grace to look startled. Just as quickly, the look became
annoyance. “What if I have?”
“It’s Jaime Lannister, is it not?”
Robert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the
barrows. Ned kept pace with him. The king rode on, eyes straight ahead. “Yes,” he said at
last. A single hard word to end the matter.
“Kingslayer,” Ned said. The rumors were true, then. He rode on dangerous ground now,
he knew. “An able and courageous man, no doubt,” he said carefully, “but his father is
Warden of the West, Robert. In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor. No one man
should hold both East and West.” He left unsaid his real concern; that the appointment
would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of Lannisters.
“I will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field,” the king said stubbornly.
“At the moment, Lord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock, so I doubt that Jaime will
be succeeding anytime soon. Don’t vex me about this, Ned, the stone has been set.”
“Your Grace, may I speak frankly?”
“I seem unable to stop you,” Robert grumbled. They rode through tall brown grasses.
“Can you trust Jaime Lannister?”
“He is my wife’s twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor
all bound to mine.”
“As they were bound to Aerys Targaryen’s,” Ned pointed out.
“Why should I mistrust him? He has done everything I have ever asked of him. His
sword helped win the throne I sit on.”
His sword helped taint the throne you sit on, Ned thought, but he did not permit the
words to pass his lips. “He swore a vow to protect his king’s life with his own. Then he
opened that king’s throat with a sword.”
“Seven hells, someone had to kill Aerys!” Robert said, reining his mount to a sudden halt
beside an ancient barrow. “If Jaime hadn’t done it, it would have been left for you or me.”
“We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard,” Ned said. The time had come for
Robert to hear the whole truth, he decided then and there. “Do you remember the
Trident, Your Grace?”
“I won my crown there. How should I forget it?”
“You took a wound from Rhaegar,” Ned reminded him. “So when the Targaryen host
broke and ran, you gave the pursuit into my hands. The remnants of Rhaegar’s army fled
back to King’s Landing. We followed. Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand
loyalists. I expected to find the gates closed to us.”
Robert gave an impatient shake of his head. “Instead you found that our men had
already taken the city. What of it?”
“Not our men,” Ned said patiently. “Lannister men. The lion of Lannister flew over the
ramparts, not the crowned stag. And they had taken the city by treachery.”
The war had raged for close to a year. Lords great and small had flocked to Robert’s
banners; others had remained loyal to Targaryen. The mighty Lannisters of Casterly
Rock, the Wardens of the West, had remained aloof from the struggle, ignoring calls to
arms from both rebels and royalists. Aerys Targaryen must have thought that his gods
had answered his prayers when Lord Tywin Lannister appeared before the gates of
King’s Landing with an army twelve thousand strong, professing loyalty. So the mad
king had ordered his last mad act. He had opened his city to the lions at the gate.
“Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well,” Robert said. The anger was building in
him again. “Lannister paid them back in kind. It was no less than they deserved. I shall
not trouble my sleep over it.”
“You were not there,” Ned said, bitterness in his voice. Troubled sleep was no stranger to
him. He had lived his lies for fourteen years, yet they still haunted him at night. “There
was no honor in that conquest.”
“The Others take your honor!” Robert swore. “What did any Targaryen ever know of
honor? Go down into your crypt and ask Lyanna about the dragon’s honor!”
“You avenged Lyanna at the Trident,” Ned said, halting beside the king. Promise me,
Ned, she had whispered.
“That did not bring her back.” Robert looked away, off into the grey distance. “The gods
be damned. It was a hollow victory they gave me. A crown . . . it was the girl I prayed
them for. Your sister, safe . . . and mine again, as she was meant to be. I ask you, Ned,
what good is it to wear a crown? The gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike.”
“I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace . . . only for what I found when I rode into the
throne room that day,” Ned said. “Aerys was dead on the floor, drowned in his own
blood. His dragon skulls stared down from the walls. Lannister’s men were everywhere.
Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor. I can see him still.
Even his sword was gilded. He was seated on the Iron Throne, high above his knights,
wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion’s head. How he glittered!”
“This is well known,” the king complained.
“I was still mounted. I rode the length of the hall in silence, between the long rows of
dragon skulls. It felt as though they were watching me, somehow. I stopped in front of
the throne, looking up at him. His golden sword was across his legs, its edge red with a
king’s blood. My men were filling the room behind me. Lannister’s men drew back. I
never said a word. I looked at him seated there on the throne, and I waited. At last Jaime
laughed and got up. He took off his helm, and he said to me, ‘Have no fear, Stark. I was
only keeping it warm for our friend Robert. It’s not a very comfortable seat, I’m afraid.’ ”
The king threw back his head and roared. His laughter startled a flight of crows from the
tall brown grass. They took to the air in a wild beating of wings. “You think I should
mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments?” He shook with
laughter again. “Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned. Scarce more than a boy.”
“Boy or man, he had no right to that throne.”
“Perhaps he was tired,” Robert suggested. “Killing kings is weary work. Gods know,
there’s no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room. And he spoke truly, it is a
monstrous uncomfortable chair. In more ways than one.” The king shook his head.
“Well, now I know Jaime’s dark sin, and the matter can be forgotten. I am heartily sick
of secrets and squabbles and matters of state, Ned. It’s all as tedious as counting
coppers. Come, let’s ride, you used to know how. I want to feel the wind in my hair
again.” He kicked his horse back into motion and galloped up over the barrow, raining
earth down behind him.
For a moment Ned did not follow. He had run out of words, and he was filled with a vast
sense of helplessness. Not for the first time, he wondered what he was doing here and
why he had come. He was no Jon Arryn, to curb the wildness of his king and teach him
wisdom. Robert would do what he pleased, as he always had, and nothing Ned could say
or do would change that. He belonged in Winterfell. He belonged with Catelyn in her
grief, and with Bran.
A man could not always be where he belonged, though. Resigned, Eddard Stark put his
boots into his horse and set off after the king.

TYRION
The north went on forever.
Tyrion Lannister knew the maps as well as anyone, but a fortnight on the wild track that
passed for the kingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one
thing and the land quite another.
They had left Winterfell on the same day as the king, amidst all the commotion of the
royal departure, riding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting, to the
rattle of wagons and the groaning of the queen’s huge wheelhouse, as a light snow
flurried about them. The kingsroad was just beyond the sprawl of castle and town. There
the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders turned south,
taking the tumult with them, while Tyrion turned north with Benjen Stark and his
nephew.
It had grown colder after that, and far more quiet.
West of the road were flint hills, grey and rugged, with tall watchtowers on their stony
summits. To the east the land was lower, the ground flattening to a rolling plain that
stretched away as far as the eye could see. Stone bridges spanned swift, narrow rivers,
while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in wood and stone. The road
was well trafficked, and at night for their comfort there were rude inns to be found.
Three days ride from Winterfell, however, the farmland gave way to dense wood, and the
kingsroad grew lonely. The flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile, until
by the fifth day they had turned into mountains, cold blue-grey giants with jagged
promontories and snow on their shoulders. When the wind blew from the north, long
plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like banners.
With the mountains a wall to the west, the road veered north by northeast through the
wood, a forest of oak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older and darker than
any Tyrion had ever seen. “The wolfswood,” Benjen Stark called it, and indeed their
nights came alive with the howls of distant packs, and some not so distant. Jon Snow’s
albino direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling, but never raised his own voice
in reply. There was something very unsettling about that animal, Tyrion thought.
There were eight in the party by then, not counting the wolf. Tyrion traveled with two of
his own men, as befit a Lannister. Benjen Stark had only his bastard nephew and some
fresh mounts for the Night’s Watch, but at the edge of the wolfswood they stayed a night
behind the wooden walls of a forest holdfast, and there joined up with another of the
black brothers, one Yoren. Yoren was stooped and sinister, his features hidden behind a
beard as black as his clothing, but he seemed as tough as an old root and as hard as
stone. With him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the Fingers. “Rapers,” Yoren
said with a cold look at his charges. Tyrion understood. Life on the Wall was said to be
hard, but no doubt it was preferable to castration.
Five men, three boys, a direwolf, twenty horses, and a cage of ravens given over to
Benjen Stark by Maester Luwin. No doubt they made a curious fellowship for the
kingsroad, or any road.
Tyrion noticed Jon Snow watching Yoren and his sullen companions, with an odd cast to
his face that looked uncomfortably like dismay. Yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour
smell, his hair and beard were matted and greasy and full of lice, his clothing old,
patched, and seldom washed. His two young recruits smelled even worse, and seemed as
stupid as they were cruel.
No doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the Night’s Watch was made up
of men like his uncle. If so, Yoren and his companions were a rude awakening. Tyrion
felt sorry for the boy. He had chosen a hard life . . . or perhaps he should say that a hard
life had been chosen for him.
He had rather less sympathy for the uncle. Benjen Stark seemed to share his brother’s
distaste for Lannisters, and he had not been pleased when Tyrion had told him of his
intentions. “I warn you, Lannister, you’ll find no inns at the Wall,” he had said, looking
down on him.
“No doubt you’ll find some place to put me,” Tyrion had replied. “As you might have
noticed, I’m small.”
One did not say no to the queen’s brother, of course, so that had settled the matter, but
Stark had not been happy. “You will not like the ride, I promise you that,” he’d said
curtly, and since the moment they set out, he had done all he could to live up to that
promise.
By the end of the first week, Tyrion’s thighs were raw from hard riding, his legs were
cramping badly, and he was chilled to the bone. He did not complain. He was damned if
he would give Benjen Stark that satisfaction.
He took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur, a tattered bearskin, old and
musty-smelling. Stark had offered it to him in an excess of Night’s Watch gallantry, no
doubt expecting him to graciously decline. Tyrion had accepted with a smile. He had
brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode out of Winterfell, and soon
discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough. It was cold up here, and growing
colder. The nights were well below freezing now, and when the wind blew it was like a
knife cutting right through his warmest woolens. By now Stark was no doubt regretting
his chivalrous impulse. Perhaps he had learned a lesson. The Lannisters never declined,
graciously or otherwise. The Lannisters took what was offered.
Farms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward, ever deeper
into the darkness of the wolfswood, until finally there were no more roofs to shelter
under, and they were thrown back on their own resources.
Tyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one. Too small, too hobbled,
too in-the-way. So while Stark and Yoren and the other men erected rude shelters,
tended the horses, and built a fire, it became his custom to take his fur and a wineskin
and go off by himself to read.
On the eighteenth night of their journey, the wine was a rare sweet amber from the
Summer Isles that he had brought all the way north from Casterly Rock, and the book a
rumination on the history and properties of dragons. With Lord Eddard Stark’s
permission, Tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes from the Winterfell library and
packed them for the ride north.
He found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp, beside a swift-running
stream with waters clear and cold as ice. A grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter
from the biting wind. Tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk, took a
sip of the wine, and began to read about the properties of dragonbone. Dragonbone is
black because of its high iron content, the book told him. It is strong as steel, yet lighter
and far more flexible, and of course utterly impervious to fire. Dragonbone bows are
greatly prized by the Dothraki, and small wonder. An archer so armed can outrange
any wooden bow.
Tyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons. When he had first come to King’s
Landing for his sister’s wedding to Robert Baratheon, he had made it a point to seek out
the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of Targaryen’s throne room. King Robert
had replaced them with banners and tapestries, but Tyrion had persisted until he found
the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored.
He had expected to find them impressive, perhaps even frightening. He had not thought
to find them beautiful. Yet they were. As black as onyx, polished smooth, so the bone
seemed to shimmer in the light of his torch. They liked the fire, he sensed. He’d thrust
the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls and made the shadows leap and
dance on the wall behind him. The teeth were long, curving knives of black diamond.
The flame of the torch was nothing to them; they had bathed in the heat of far greater
fires. When he had moved away, Tyrion could have sworn that the beast’s empty eye
sockets had watched him go.
There were nineteen skulls. The oldest was more than three thousand years old; the
youngest a mere century and a half. The most recent were also the smallest; a matched
pair no bigger than mastiff’s skulls, and oddly misshapen, all that remained of the last
two hatchlings born on Dragonstone. They were the last of the Targaryen dragons,
perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and they had not lived very long.
From there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and
story, the dragons that Aegon Targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the Seven
Kingdoms of old. The singers had given them the names of gods: Balerion, Meraxes,
Vhaghar. Tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws, wordless and awed. You could
have ridden a horse down Vhaghar’s gullet, although you would not have ridden it out
again. Meraxes was even bigger. And the greatest of them, Balerion, the Black Dread,
could have swallowed an aurochs whole, or even one of the hairy mammoths said to
roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben.
Tyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time, staring at Balerion’s huge, empty-eyed
skull until his torch burned low, trying to grasp the size of the living animal, to imagine
how it must have looked when it spread its great black wings and swept across the skies,
breathing fire.
His own remote ancestor, King Loren of the Rock, had tried to stand against the fire
when he joined with King Mern of the Reach to oppose the Targaryen conquest. That
was close on three hundred years ago, when the Seven Kingdoms were kingdoms, and
not mere provinces of a greater realm. Between them, the Two Kings had six hundred
banners flying, five thousand mounted knights, and ten times as many freeriders and
men-at-arms. Aegon Dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number, the chroniclers said,
and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king he had slain, their
loyalties uncertain.
The hosts met on the broad plains of the Reach, amidst golden fields of wheat ripe for
harvest. When the Two Kings charged, the Targaryen army shivered and shattered and
began to run. For a few moments, the chroniclers wrote, the conquest was at an
end . . . but only for those few moments, before Aegon Targaryen and his sisters joined
the battle.
It was the only time that Vhaghar, Meraxes, and Balerion were all unleashed at once.
The singers called it the Field of Fire.
Near four thousand men had burned that day, among them King Mern of the Reach.
King Loren had escaped, and lived long enough to surrender, pledge his fealty to the
Targaryens, and beget a son, for which Tyrion was duly grateful.
“Why do you read so much?”
Tyrion looked up at the sound of the voice. Jon Snow was standing a few feet away,
regarding him curiously. He closed the book on a finger and said, “Look at me and tell
me what you see.”
The boy looked at him suspiciously. “Is this some kind of trick? I see you. Tyrion
Lannister.”
Tyrion sighed. “You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow. What you see is a dwarf.
You are what, twelve?”
“Fourteen,” the boy said.
“Fourteen, and you’re taller than I will ever be. My legs are short and twisted, and I walk
with difficulty. I require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse. A saddle of
my own design, you may be interested to know. It was either that or ride a pony. My
arms are strong enough, but again, too short. I will never make a swordsman. Had I
been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold me to some slaver’s
grotesquerie. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and the grotesqueries are all
the poorer. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for twenty
years. My brother later killed that very same king, as it turns out, but life is full of these
little ironies. My sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after
him. I must do my part for the honor of my House, wouldn’t you agree? Yet how? Well,
my legs may be too small for my body, but my head is too large, although I prefer to
think it is just large enough for my mind. I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths
and weaknesses. My mind is my weapon. My brother has his sword, King Robert has his
warhammer, and I have my mind . . . and a mind needs books as a sword needs a
whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.” Tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book. “That’s
why I read so much, Jon Snow.”
The boy absorbed that all in silence. He had the Stark face if not the name: long, solemn,
guarded, a face that gave nothing away. Whoever his mother had been, she had left little
of herself in her son. “What are you reading about?” he asked.
“Dragons,” Tyrion told him.
“What good is that? There are no more dragons,” the boy said with the easy certainty of
youth.
“So they say,” Tyrion replied. “Sad, isn’t it? When I was your age, used to dream of
having a dragon of my own.”
“You did?” the boy said suspiciously. Perhaps he thought Tyrion was making fun of him.
“Oh, yes. Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when he’s
seated on a dragon’s back.” Tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet. “I
used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours,
pretending they were dragonfire. Sometimes I’d imagine my father burning. At other
times, my sister.” Jon Snow was staring at him, a look equal parts horror and
fascination. Tyrion guffawed. “Don’t look at me that way, bastard. I know your secret.
You’ve dreamt the same kind of dreams.”
“No,” Jon Snow said, horrified. “I wouldn’t . . . ”
“No? Never?” Tyrion raised an eyebrow. “Well, no doubt the Starks have been terribly
good to you. I’m certain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of her own. And your
brother Robb, he’s always been kind, and why not? He gets Winterfell and you get the
Wall. And your father . . . he must have good reasons for packing you off to the Night’s
Watch . . . ”
“Stop it,” Jon Snow said, his face dark with anger. “The Night’s Watch is a noble calling!”
Tyrion laughed. “You’re too smart to believe that. The Night’s Watch is a midden heap
for all the misfits of the realm. I’ve seen you looking at Yoren and his boys. Those are
your new brothers, Jon Snow, how do you like them? Sullen peasants, debtors, poachers,
rapers, thieves, and bastards like you all wind up on the Wall, watching for grumkins
and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. The good part
is there are no grumkins or snarks, so it’s scarcely dangerous work. The bad part is you
freeze your balls off, but since you’re not allowed to breed anyway, I don’t suppose that
matters.”
“Stop it!” the boy screamed. He took a step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to
tears.
Suddenly, absurdly, Tyrion felt guilty. He took a step forward, intending to give the boy a
reassuring pat on the shoulder or mutter some word of apology.
He never saw the wolf, where it was or how it came at him. One moment he was walking
toward Snow and the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky ground, the book
spinning away from him as he fell, the breath going out of him at the sudden impact, his
mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves. As he tried to get up, his back spasmed
painfully. He must have wrenched it in the fall. He ground his teeth in frustration,
grabbed a root, and pulled himself back to a sitting position. “Help me,” he said to the
boy, reaching up a hand.
And suddenly the wolf was between them. He did not growl. The damned thing never
made a sound. He only looked at him with those bright red eyes, and showed him his
teeth, and that was more than enough. Tyrion sagged back to the ground with a grunt.
“Don’t help me, then. I’ll sit right here until you leave.”
Jon Snow stroked Ghost’s thick white fur, smiling now. “Ask me nicely.”
Tyrion Lannister felt the anger coiling inside him, and crushed it out with a will. It was
not the first time in his life he had been humiliated, and it would not be the last. Perhaps
he even deserved this. “I should be very grateful for your kind assistance, Jon,” he said
mildly.
“Down, Ghost,” the boy said. The direwolf sat on his haunches. Those red eyes never left
Tyrion. Jon came around behind him, slid his hands under his arms, and lifted him
easily to his feet. Then he picked up the book and handed it back.
“Why did he attack me?” Tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf. He wiped
blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Maybe he thought you were a grumkin.”
Tyrion glanced at him sharply. Then he laughed, a raw snort of amusement that came
bursting out through his nose entirely without his permission. “Oh, gods,” he said,
choking on his laughter and shaking his head, “I suppose I do rather look like a grumkin.
What does he do to snarks?”
“You don’t want to know.” Jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to Tyrion.
Tyrion pulled out the stopper, tilted his head, and squeezed a long stream into his
mouth. The wine was cool fire as it trickled down his throat and warmed his belly. He
held out the skin to Jon Snow. “Want some?”
The boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow. “It’s true, isn’t it?” he said when he
was done. “What you said about the Night’s Watch.”
Tyrion nodded.
Jon Snow set his mouth in a grim line. “If that’s what it is, that’s what it is.”
Tyrion grinned at him. “That’s good, bastard. Most men would rather deny a hard truth
than face it.”
“Most men,” the boy said. “But not you.”
“No,” Tyrion admitted, “not me. I seldom even dream of dragons anymore. There are no
dragons.” He scooped up the fallen bearskin. “Come, we had better return to camp
before your uncle calls the banners.”
The walk was short, but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping
badly by the time they got back. Jon Snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle
of roots, but Tyrion shook him off. He would make his own way, as he had all his life.
Still, the camp was a welcome sight. The shelters had been thrown up against the
tumbledown wall of a long-abandoned holdfast, a shield against the wind. The horses
had been fed and a fire had been laid. Yoren sat on a stone, skinning a squirrel. The
savory smell of stew filled Tyrion’s nostrils. He dragged himself over to where his man
Morrec was tending the stewpot. Wordlessly, Morrec handed him the ladle. Tyrion
tasted and handed it back. “More pepper,” he said.
Benjen Stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew. “There you are. Jon,
damn it, don’t go off like that by yourself. I thought the Others had gotten you.”
“It was the grumkins,” Tyrion told him, laughing. Jon Snow smiled. Stark shot a baffled
look at Yoren. The old man grunted, shrugged, and went back to his bloody work.
The squirrel gave some body to the stew, and they ate it with black bread and hard
cheese that night around their fire. Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even
Yoren grew mellow. One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all
but Jon Snow, who had drawn the night’s first watch.
Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built
for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face
still and hard, looking deep into the flames.
Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed.

CATELYN
Ned and the girls were eight days gone when Maester Luwin came to her one night in
Bran’s sickroom, carrying a reading lamp and the books of account. “It is past time that
we reviewed the figures, my lady,” he said. “You’ll want to know how much this royal
visit cost us.”
Catelyn looked at Bran in his sickbed and brushed his hair back off his forehead. It had
grown very long, she realized. She would have to cut it soon. “I have no need to look at
figures, Maester Luwin,” she told him, never taking her eyes from Bran. “I know what
the visit cost us. Take the books away.”
“My lady, the king’s party had healthy appetites. We must replenish our stores before—”
She cut him off. “I said, take the books away. The steward will attend to our needs.”
“We have no steward,” Maester Luwin reminded her. Like a little grey rat, she thought,
he would not let go. “Poole went south to establish Lord Eddard’s household at King’s
Landing.”
Catelyn nodded absently. “Oh, yes. I remember.” Bran looked so pale. She wondered
whether they might move his bed under the window, so he could get the morning sun.
Maester Luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with its wick. “There are
several appointments that require your immediate attention, my lady. Besides the
steward, we need a captain of the guards to fill Jory’s place, a new master of horse—”
Her eyes snapped around and found him. “A master of horse?” Her voice was a whip.
The maester was shaken. “Yes, my lady. Hullen rode south with Lord Eddard, so—”
“My son lies here broken and dying, Luwin, and you wish to discuss a new master of
horse? Do you think I care what happens in the stables? Do you think it matters to me
one whit? I would gladly butcher every horse in Winterfell with my own hands if it would
open Bran’s eyes, do you understand that? Do you?”
He bowed his head. “Yes, my lady, but the appointments—”
“I’ll make the appointments,” Robb said.
Catelyn had not heard him enter, but there he stood in the doorway, looking at her. She
had been shouting, she realized with a sudden flush of shame. What was happening to
her? She was so tired, and her head hurt all the time.
Maester Luwin looked from Catelyn to her son. “I have prepared a list of those we might
wish to consider for the vacant offices,” he said, offering Robb a paper plucked from his
sleeve.
Her son glanced at the names. He had come from outside, Catelyn saw; his cheeks were
red from the cold, his hair shaggy and windblown. “Good men,” he said. “We’ll talk
about them tomorrow.” He handed back the list of names.
“Very good, my lord.” The paper vanished into his sleeve.
“Leave us now,” Robb said. Maester Luwin bowed and departed. Robb closed the door
behind him and turned to her. He was wearing a sword, she saw. “Mother, what are you
doing?”
Catelyn had always thought Robb looked like her; like Bran and Rickon and Sansa, he
had the Tully coloring, the auburn hair, the blue eyes. Yet now for the first time she saw
something of Eddard Stark in his face, something as stern and hard as the north. “What
am I doing?” she echoed, puzzled. “How can you ask that? What do you imagine I’m
doing? I am taking care of your brother. I am taking care of Bran.”
“Is that what you call it? You haven’t left this room since Bran was hurt. You didn’t even
come to the gate when Father and the girls went south.”
“I said my farewells to them here, and watched them ride out from that window.” She
had begged Ned not to go, not now, not after what had happened; everything had
changed now, couldn’t he see that? It was no use. He had no choice, he had told her, and
then he left, choosing. “I can’t leave him, even for a moment, not when any moment
could be his last. I have to be with him, if . . . if . . . ” She took her son’s limp hand, sliding
his fingers through her own. He was so frail and thin, with no strength left in his hand,
but she could still feel the warmth of life through his skin.
Robb’s voice softened. “He’s not going to die, Mother. Maester Luwin says the time of
greatest danger has passed.”
“And what if Maester Luwin is wrong? What if Bran needs me and I’m not here?”
“Rickon needs you,” Robb said sharply. “He’s only three, he doesn’t understand what’s
happening. He thinks everyone has deserted him, so he follows me around all day,
clutching my leg and crying. I don’t know what to do with him.” He paused a moment,
chewing on his lower lip the way he’d done when he was little. “Mother, I need you too.
I’m trying but I can’t . . . I can’t do it all by myself.” His voice broke with sudden
emotion, and Catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen. She wanted to get up and
go to him, but Bran was still holding her hand and she could not move.
Outside the tower, a wolf began to howl. Catelyn trembled, just for a second.
“Bran’s.” Robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room. The
howling grew louder. It was a cold and lonely sound, full of melancholy and despair.
“Don’t,” she told him. “Bran needs to stay warm.”
“He needs to hear them sing,” Robb said. Somewhere out in Winterfell, a second wolf
began to howl in chorus with the first. Then a third, closer. “Shaggydog and Grey Wind,”
Robb said as their voices rose and fell together. “You can tell them apart if you listen
close.”
Catelyn was shaking. It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves. Night after
night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went,
never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the
gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood, all gone now,
she would never hear him laugh again. Sobbing, she pulled her hand free of his and
covered her ears against those terrible howls. “Make them stop!” she cried. “I can’t stand
it, make them stop, make them stop, kill them all if you must, just make them stop!”
She didn’t remember falling to the floor, but there she was, and Robb was lifting her,
holding her in strong arms. “Don’t be afraid, Mother. They would never hurt him.” He
helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom. “Close your eyes,” he said
gently. “Rest. Maester Luwin tells me you’ve hardly slept since Bran’s fall.”
“I can’t,” she wept. “Gods forgive me, Robb, I can’t, what if he dies while I’m asleep,
what if he dies, what if he dies . . . ” The wolves were still howling. She screamed and
held her ears again. “Oh, gods, close the window!”
“If you swear to me you’ll sleep.” Robb went to the window, but as he reached for the
shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves. “Dogs,” he
said, listening. “All the dogs are barking. They’ve never done that before . . . ” Catelyn
heard his breath catch in his throat. When she looked up, his face was pale in the
lamplight. “Fire,” he whispered.
Fire, she thought, and then, Bran! “Help me,” she said urgently, sitting up. “Help me
with Bran.”
Robb did not seem to hear her. “The library tower’s on fire,” he said.
Catelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now. She sagged
with relief. Bran was safe. The library was across the bailey, there was no way the fire
would reach them here. “Thank the gods,” she whispered.
Robb looked at her as if she’d gone mad. “Mother, stay here. I’ll come back as soon as
the fire’s out.” He ran then. She heard him shout to the guards outside the room, heard
them descending together in a wild rush, taking the stairs two and three at a time.
Outside, there were shouts of “Fire!” in the yard, screams, running footsteps, the whinny
of frightened horses, and the frantic barking of the castle dogs. The howling was gone,
she realized as she listened to the cacophony. The direwolves had fallen silent.
Catelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to the
window. Across the bailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library.
She watched the smoke rise into the sky and thought sadly of all the books the Starks
had gathered over the centuries. Then she closed the shutters.
When she turned away from the window, the man was in the room with her.
“You weren’t s’posed to be here,” he muttered sourly. “No one was s’posed to be here.”
He was a small, dirty man in filthy brown clothing, and he stank of horses. Catelyn knew
all the men who worked in their stables, and he was none of them. He was gaunt, with
limp blond hair and pale eyes deep-sunk in a bony face, and there was a dagger in his
hand.
Catelyn looked at the knife, then at Bran. “No,” she said. The word stuck in her throat,
the merest whisper.
He must have heard her. “It’s a mercy,” he said. “He’s dead already.”
“No,” Catelyn said, louder now as she found her voice again. “No, you can’t.” She spun
back toward the window to scream for help, but the man moved faster than she would
have believed. One hand clamped down over her mouth and yanked back her head, the
other brought the dagger up to her windpipe. The stench of him was overwhelming.
She reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all her strength, pulling it
away from her throat. She heard him cursing into her ear. Her fingers were slippery with
blood, but she would not let go of the dagger. The hand over her mouth clenched more
tightly, shutting off her air. Catelyn twisted her head to the side and managed to get a
piece of his flesh between her teeth. She bit down hard into his palm. The man grunted
in pain. She ground her teeth together and tore at him, and all of a sudden he let go. The
taste of his blood filled her mouth. She sucked in air and screamed, and he grabbed her
hair and pulled her away from him, and she stumbled and went down, and then he was
standing over her, breathing hard, shaking. The dagger was still clutched tightly in his
right hand, slick with blood. “You weren’t s’posed to be here,” he repeated stupidly.
Catelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him. There was a low rumble,
less than a snarl, the merest whisper of a threat, but he must have heard something,
because he started to turn just as the wolf made its leap. They went down together, half
sprawled over Catelyn where she’d fallen. The wolf had him under the jaw. The man’s
shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back its head, taking out half
his throat.
His blood felt like warm rain as it sprayed across her face.
The wolf was looking at her. Its jaws were red and wet and its eyes glowed golden in the
dark room. It was Bran’s wolf, she realized. Of course it was. “Thank you,” Catelyn
whispered, her voice faint and tiny. She lifted her hand, trembling. The wolf padded
closer, sniffed at her fingers, then licked at the blood with a wet rough tongue. When it
had cleaned all the blood off her hand, it turned away silently and jumped up on Bran’s
bed and lay down beside him. Catelyn began to laugh hysterically.
That was the way they found them, when Robb and Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik burst
in with half the guards in Winterfell. When the laughter finally died in her throat, they
wrapped her in warm blankets and led her back to the Great Keep, to her own chambers.
Old Nan undressed her and helped her into a scalding hot bath and washed the blood off
her with a soft cloth.
Afterward Maester Luwin arrived to dress her wounds. The cuts in her fingers went
deep, almost to the bone, and her scalp was raw and bleeding where he’d pulled out a
handful of hair. The maester told her the pain was just starting now, and gave her milk
of the poppy to help her sleep.
Finally she closed her eyes.
When she opened them again, they told her that she had slept four days. Catelyn nodded
and sat up in bed. It all seemed like a nightmare to her now, everything since Bran’s fall,
a terrible dream of blood and grief, but she had the pain in her hands to remind her that
it was real. She felt weak and light-headed, yet strangely resolute, as if a great weight had
lifted from her.
“Bring me some bread and honey,” she told her servants, “and take word to Maester
Luwin that my bandages want changing.” They looked at her in surprise and ran to do
her bidding.
Catelyn remembered the way she had been before, and she was ashamed. She had let
them all down, her children, her husband, her House. It would not happen again. She
would show these northerners how strong a Tully of Riverrun could be.
Robb arrived before her food. Rodrik Cassel came with him, and her husband’s ward
Theon Greyjoy, and lastly Hallis Mollen, a muscular guardsman with a square brown
beard. He was the new captain of the guard, Robb said. Her son was dressed in boiled
leather and ringmail, she saw, and a sword hung at his waist.
“Who was he?” Catelyn asked them.
“No one knows his name,” Hallis Mollen told her. “He was no man of Winterfell, m’lady,
but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks.”
“One of the king’s men, then,” she said, “or one of the Lannisters’. He could have waited
behind when the others left.”
“Maybe,” Hal said. “With all these strangers filling up Winterfell of late, there’s no way
of saying who he belonged to.”
“He’d been hiding in your stables,” Greyjoy said. “You could smell it on him.”
“And how could he go unnoticed?” she said sharply.
Hallis Mollen looked abashed. “Between the horses Lord Eddard took south and them
we sent north to the Night’s Watch, the stalls were half-empty. It were no great trick to
hide from the stableboys. Could be Hodor saw him, the talk is that boy’s been acting
queer, but simple as he is . . . ” Hal shook his head.
“We found where he’d been sleeping,” Robb put in. “He had ninety silver stags in a
leather bag buried beneath the straw.”
“It’s good to know my son’s life was not sold cheaply,” Catelyn said bitterly.
Hallis Mollen looked at her, confused. “Begging your grace, m’lady, you saying he was
out to kill your boy?”
Greyjoy was doubtful. “That’s madness.”
“He came for Bran,” Catelyn said. “He kept muttering how I wasn’t supposed to be there.
He set the library fire thinking I would rush to put it out, taking any guards with me. If I
hadn’t been half-mad with grief, it would have worked.”
“Why would anyone want to kill Bran?” Robb said. “Gods, he’s only a little boy, helpless,
sleeping . . . ”
Catelyn gave her firstborn a challenging look. “If you are to rule in the north, you must
think these things through, Robb. Answer your own question. Why would anyone want
to kill a sleeping child?”
Before he could answer, the servants returned with a plate of food fresh from the
kitchen. There was much more than she’d asked for: hot bread, butter and honey and
blackberry preserves, a rasher of bacon and a soft-boiled egg, a wedge of cheese, a pot of
mint tea. And with it came Maester Luwin.
“How is my son, Maester?” Catelyn looked at all the food and found she had no appetite.
Maester Luwin lowered his eyes. “Unchanged, my lady.”
It was the reply she had expected, no more and no less. Her hands throbbed with pain,
as if the blade were still in her, cutting deep. She sent the servants away and looked back
to Robb. “Do you have the answer yet?”
“Someone is afraid Bran might wake up,” Robb said, “afraid of what he might say or do,
afraid of something he knows.”
Catelyn was proud of him. “Very good.” She turned to the new captain of the guard. “We
must keep Bran safe. If there was one killer, there could be others.”
“How many guards do you want, rn’lady?” Hal asked.
“So long as Lord Eddard is away, my son is the master of Winterfell,” she told him.
Robb stood a little taller. “Put one man in the sickroom, night and day, one outside the
door, two at the bottom of the stairs. No one sees Bran without my warrant or my
mother’s.”
“As you say, m’lord.”
“Do it now,” Catelyn suggested.
“And let his wolf stay in the room with him,” Robb added.
“Yes,” Catelyn said. And then again: “Yes.”
Hallis Mollen bowed and left the room.
“Lady Stark,” Ser Rodrik said when the guardsman had gone, “did you chance to notice
the dagger the killer used?”
“The circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely, but I can vouch for its edge,”
Catelyn replied with a dry smile. “Why do you ask?”
“We found the knife still in the villain’s grasp. It seemed to me that it was altogether too
fine a weapon for such a man, so I looked at it long and hard. The blade is Valyrian steel,
the hilt dragonbone. A weapon like that has no business being in the hands of such as
him. Someone gave it to him.”
Catelyn nodded, thoughtful. “Robb, close the door.”
He looked at her strangely, but did as she told him.
“What I am about to tell you must not leave this room,” she told them. “I want your
oaths on that. If even part of what I suspect is true, Ned and my girls have ridden into
deadly danger, and a word in the wrong ears could mean their lives.”
“Lord Eddard is a second father to me,” said Theon Greyjoy. “I do so swear.”
“You have my oath,” Maester Luwin said.
“And mine, my lady,” echoed Ser Rodrik.
She looked at her son. “And you, Robb?”
He nodded his consent.
“My sister Lysa believes the Lannisters murdered her husband, Lord Arryn, the Hand of
the King,” Catelyn told them. “It comes to me that Jaime Lannister did not join the hunt
the day Bran fell. He remained here in the castle.” The room was deathly quiet. “I do not
think Bran fell from that tower,” she said into the stillness. “I think he was thrown.”
The shock was plain on their faces. “My lady, that is a monstrous suggestion,” said
Rodrik Cassel. “Even the Kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child.”
“Oh, would he?” Theon Greyjoy asked. “I wonder.”
“There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition,” Catelyn said.
“The boy had always been surehanded in the past,” Maester Luwin said thoughtfully.
“He knew every stone in Winterfell.”
“Gods,” Robb swore, his young face dark with anger. “If this is true, he will pay for it.”
He drew his sword and waved it in the air. “I’ll kill him myself!”
Ser Rodrik bristled at him. “Put that away! The Lannisters are a hundred leagues away.
Never draw your sword unless you mean to use it. How many times must I tell you,
foolish boy?”
Abashed, Robb sheathed his sword, suddenly a child again. Catelyn said to Ser Rodrik, “I
see my son is wearing steel now.”
The old master-at-arms said, “I thought it was time.”
Robb was looking at her anxiously. “Past time,” she said. “Winterfell may have need of
all its swords soon, and they had best not be made of wood.”
Theon Greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of his blade and said, “My lady, if it comes to that,
my House owes yours a great debt.”
Maester Luwin pulled at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck. “All we have is
conjecture. This is the queen’s beloved brother we mean to accuse. She will not take it
kindly. We must have proof, or forever keep silent.”
“Your proof is in the dagger,” Ser Rodrik said. “A fine blade like that will not have gone
unnoticed.”
There was only one place to find the truth of it, Catelyn realized. “Someone must go to
King’s Landing.”
“I’ll go,” Robb said.
“No,” she told him. “Your place is here. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.” She
looked at Ser Rodrik with his great white whiskers, at Maester Luwin in his grey robes,
at young Greyjoy, lean and dark and impetuous. Who to send? Who would be believed?
Then she knew. Catelyn struggled to push back the blankets, her bandaged fingers as
stiff and unyielding as stone. She climbed out of bed. “I must go myself.”
“My lady,” said Maester Luwin, “is that wise? Surely the Lannisters would greet your
arrival with suspicion.”
“What about Bran?” Robb asked. The poor boy looked utterly confused now. “You can’t
mean to leave him.”
“I have done everything I can for Bran,” she said, laying a wounded hand on his arm.
“His life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin. As you reminded me yourself,
Robb, I have other children to think of now.”
“You will need a strong escort, my lady,” Theon said.
“I’ll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen,” Robb said.
“No,” Catelyn said. “A large party attracts unwelcome attention. I would not have the
Lannisters know I am coming.”
Ser Rodrik protested. “My lady, let me accompany you at least. The kingsroad can be
perilous for a woman alone.”
“I will not be taking the kingsroad,” Catelyn replied. She thought for a moment, then
nodded her consent. “Two riders can move as fast as one, and a good deal faster than a
long column burdened by wagons and wheelhouses. I will welcome your company, Ser
Rodrik. We will follow the White Knife down to the sea, and hire a ship at White Harbor.
Strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to King’s Landing well ahead of Ned and
the Lannisters.” And then, she thought, we shall see what we shall see.
